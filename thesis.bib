Considering the challenges of software development, developer experience is a highly unstudied topic. Developers are users of multifaceted development tools such as integrated development environments. Yet, little is known of how to support developers in their demanding tasks. This paper presents early results towards increasing the understanding of developer experience in order to enable improvement of development tools to better support software developers in their activities. We present qualitative results of a survey study with 45 developers from 21 countries considering developers' perception of a particular integrated development environment.},

    abstract        = "Context
    A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts, videos and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and –practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have recently started to appear in software engineering (SE). As more MLR studies are conducted and reported, it is important to have a set of guidelines to ensure high quality of MLR processes and their results.
    Objective
    There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE.
    Method
    To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example.
    Results
    The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations.
    Conclusion
    Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences."

With respect to information skills, higher levels of education seem to perform best. Age did not seem to contribute to information skill related problems.

Individual strategic Internet skill related problems occurred often, with the exception of subjects with higher levels of education.

Yet, the available knowledge about the potential of certain BS techniques seem very limited in higher education. Thus, a review of previous studies on some BS types such as the traditional brainstorming (TBS), nominal brainstorming (NBS), and electronic brainstorming (EBS) was conducted. A total of 42 well-grounded studies about the use of these techniques in a university context were reviewed. The classification of these studies was based on four key schemes related to the purpose of use, opportunities, challenges, and proposed solutions in a discipline-specific context. The review results revealed a set of evidences supporting the use of TBS, NBS, and EBS in specific areas. We also provided a comprehensive view of why certain interventions can be more effective in some contexts than others. The insights gained from this review can be used to guide educational decision makers to identify the best BS practices/conditions within a university setting. It also shed light on the potential opportunities and challenges that students may experience when using certain BS rules and techniques."

    abstract = {Electronic brainstorming (EBS) has been proposed as a superior approach to both nominal brainstorming (working alone) and face-to-face brainstorming (verbal). However, existing empirical evidence regarding EBS's superiority over nominal brainstorming is weak. Through a comprehensive examination of the process gains and process losses inherent to different brainstorming approaches, this paper explains past results. The paper also suggests that the process gain versus process loss advantages of EBS technologies may not be large enough to enable EBS groups to outperform nominal groups. In an effort to find alternate ways of using EBS more productively, three conditions thought to increase EBS's process gains and decrease its process losses (thus improving its productivity) are identified. A laboratory experiment designed to compare the productivity of ad hoc and established groups using four brainstorming technologies (nominal, EBS-anonymous, EBS-nonanonymous, verbal), generating ideas on socially sensitive and less sensitive topics, in the presence and absence of contextual cues, is then described. The results of the experiment showed that overall, groups using nominal brainstorming significantly outperformed groups using the other three brainstorming approaches. Further, even under conditions thought to be favorable to EBS, nominal brainstorming groups were at least as productive as EBS groups. The paper explains these results by suggesting that the process gains of EBS may not be as large as expected and that the presence of four additional process losses inherent to EBS technologies impair its productivity. It is also argued that the prevailing popularity of group brainstorming (verbal or electronic) in organizations may be explained by the perceived productivity of those approaches. These perceptions, which are at odds with reality, create the illusion of productivity. A similar misperception may also cause an illusion of EBS productivity in the research community, especially when perceptual measures of group performance are used.}
