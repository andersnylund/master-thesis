%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% All of the above PDF/A standards have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Primarily to the PDF/A-1b standard. All the figures and graphs typically
%% use in thesis work do not require transparency features, a basic '2-D'
%% visualisation suffices. The font to be used are specified in this template
%% and they should not be changed. However, if you have figures where
%% transparency characteristics matter, use the PDF/A-2b standard. Do not use
%% the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, use jpg, png or pdf files. You may
%% have PDF/A compliance problems with figures in pdf format. Do not use PDF/A
%% compliant graphics files.
%% If you decide to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of these:
%% * the first when using pdflatex, which directly typesets your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format and you want to publish your thesis online,

%% * the second when you want to print your thesis to bind it, or
%% * the third when producing a ps file and a pdf/a from it.

Your abstract in English. Keep the abstract short. The abstract explains your

PDF/A format of this thesis, in addition to the abstract page, the abstract text is 
written into the pdf file's metadata. Write here the text that goes into the 
metadata. The metadata cannot contain special characters, linebreak or paragraph 
break characters, so these must not be used here. If your abstract does not contain 
special characters and it does not require paragraphs, you may take advantage of 
the abstracttext macro (see the comment below). Otherwise, the metadata abstract 
text must be identical to the text on the abstract page.

%% Copyright text. Copyright of a work is with the creator/author of the work

%% work. Write here the copyright text you want. It is written into the metadata
%% of the pdf file as well.
%% Syntax:
%% \copyrigthtext{metadata text}{text visible on the page}
%% 
%% In the macro below, the text written in the metadata must have a \noexpand
%% macro before the \copyright special character, and macros (\copyright and
%% \year here) must be separated by the \ character (space chacter) from the
%% text that follows. The macros in the argument of the \copyrighttext macro
%% automatically insert the year and the author's name. (Note! \ThesisAuthor is
%% an internal macro of the aaltothesis.cls class file).
%% Of course, the same text could have simply been written as
%% \copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%% {Copyright \copyright{} 2018 Eddie Engineer}
%%
\copyrighttext{Copyright \noexpand\copyright\ \number\year\ \ThesisAuthor}

%% You can prevent LaTeX from writing into the xmpdata file (it contains all the

\section{Introduction}

 {
  \color{blue}
  Create a much clearer and better foundation of what software development is, why it is complex etc.
 }

A software project is a project where a group of people share a common goal what can for example be to create a product or service. In a software project there is a developer or multiple developers that have the responsibility of implementing the technical product itself. The developers are the ones writing the executable source code for the program or service, so that it can by it's functions and features achieve the requirements set to it.

Software developers are in a crucial role when considering the success of a software project.

In this thesis the term \textit{Developer Experience} is examined and studied. Developer experience is a rather new concept in the scene of software engineering.

Developer experience can be divided into three different sub areas – cognitive (How do developers perceive the development infrastructure?), affective (How do developers feel about their work?), and conative (How do developers see the value of their contribution?) \cite{fagerholm-dx-concept-and-definition}.

\subsection{Intrinsic Motivation}


\subsection{Programmer Experience}

Programmer Experience (PX) can be defined as \textit{The result of the intrinsic motivations and perceptions of programmers about the use of development artifacts} \cite{programmer-experience}.

A programmer can be seen as person who gives exact instructions on how a program should behave and function.

\subsection{Developer Experience}

Developer Experience (DX) is a bigger construct than PX. DX includes also the motivation of developers, and not only the artefacts like the programming environments \cite{programmer-experience}. Developer Experience is considering more of the social

A developer is a person with a bigger responsibility than a programmer. If a programmer is following instructions, requirements, and guidelines, the developer is also finding out what the instructions, requirements and guidelines should be (find other source than https://devskiller.com/programmer-vs-developer/). Therefore DX is also considering more of the surrounding context than what PX is considering.

\subsection{Motivation}

{
  \color{blue} Currently sections Introduction and Motivation are intertwined. It should be made more clear that what should go where.
}

{
  \color{blue} A common theme in the thesis could be answering the question "Is Developer Experience something worth investing on in software companies?". I.e. is there any apparent reward in putting money in better tools or learning new technologies?

  After all learning new technologies is not about solving new problems, but it's about solving the same problems more efficiently, faster, easier i.e. with a better developer experience.

  Developer Experience is what is felt by the developer while trying to achieve a goal i.e. completing a project
}

Developers in software projects are in a crucial role when considering the success of software projects.

The same way as User Experience (UX) is considering the user of a system or tool, Developer Experience (DX) can be seen as the experience that developers have as users of a system. Here the system however includes the tools, frameworks, processes that the developer is the user of when developing software.

Developer experience has not been studied that much previously. There has been a doctoral thesis published about the topic recently \cite{fagerholm-doctoral-thesis}. In this thesis

DX has been studied previously, but research on it is still lacking the connection to practical applications. This is one the biggest motivators for this thesis, as the topic is novel and there is huge potential in improving software development processes, and thereby also potential to improve the outcome of the projects.

There is possibly huge value that can be gained from studying Developer Experience and learning about how it works. A better experience can help organizations

Currently a quick search with the keyword \textit{"Developer Experience"} on google gives as a result mostly articles on how framework and library authors should consider their users (developers) experience with using the product (tool, library, framework). However, DX is something more and includes also the feelings and perceptions of the developers. In some research the term \textit{Developer Experience} with the abbreviation of \textit{DE\textsuperscript{x}} is used, and in some other research the term \textit{Programmer eXperience} and abbreviation \textit{PX} is used \cite{fagerholm-dx-concept-and-definition} \cite{programmer-experience}.

It is also apparent that most results when searching with the term \textit{Developer Experience} gives results about the experience level of a developer, and not the experience of being part

\subsubsection{Selection of tools}

Perceived choice is a perception of that the choice has already been made. Selecting tools in software development projects is in a crucial role, as it can significantly improve the Developer Experience in software projects.

One study of Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and how it is connected with state of flow, intrinsic motivation, and user experience revealed that if the developers have a high perception of choice, the also are overall more satisfied with the tools \cite{kuusinen-flow}. They also concluded that if the selected tools are selected without their input, (they perceive it chosen already), the developers will have a worse developer experience with it, as e.g. their frustration with the tool will be more common.

\subsection{Research questions and problem}

The research problem is finding out \textit{How the developer experience in software projects can affect the outcome}.

{
\color{blue} The debate throughout the thesis has to be something that makes the reader interested in the topic and engages the reader.

This helps to find the argument of each article and paper that is read for this thesis. It helps the author of this thesis to take a stand when writing some statements. The meaning is not to create some kind of truth that has to be followed. The constant debate throughout the thesis helps to put things in perspective.

One example of debate is "Is Developer Experience something worth investing in?".

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
      \textbf{RQ 1} & How is Developer Experience defined in software projects?
      \\
      \textbf{RQ 2} & What aspects of Developer Experience are currently being considered in software projects? What aspects of Developer Experience do developers see as valuable?
      \\
      \textbf{RQ 3} & Can the results of software projects be improved by investing in a better developer experience?
    \end{tabularx}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Alternative research problems:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item [--] "How Developer Experience affects the productivity of developers in software projects"?
  \item [--] "How the cognitive Developer Experience can affect the outcome of Software Projects". This would allow to restrict the scope of the thesis significantly, as the cognitive Developer Experience takes only into account the \textit{"technical"} parts e.g. Platform, techniques, process, skill, procedures (How developers perceive the development infrastructure?) \cite{fagerholm-dx-concept-and-definition}
\end{enumerate}

There could be some hypotheses that will be tested in the thesis.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Background and literature review
  \item \dots

\section{Background and literature review}

 {
  \color{blue}

  Keywords to search background and literature material with:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Developer Experience
    \item Programmer Experience
    \item Happy Developer
    \item Unhappy Developer
  \end{enumerate}
 }

This section includes the background and literature review of the topic. The background of the topic should be covered equally from all points of view.

The Developer Experience can be divided into 2 different environments, a social and a technical environment \cite{fagerholm-doctoral-thesis}. This thesis might focus more on the technical environment.

A common terminology and understanding of Developer Experience is part examining a project's Developer Experience.

\subsection{Performance Alignment Work}

\section{Research material and methods}

What material will be used in the research and what methods/methodologies will be used to study the problem. What kind of approach to research will be used in the thesis.

The developer experience can be both short term impulsive, or related to one event in software development, but it can also be a long term experience over a period of time \cite{fagerholm-doctoral-thesis}. The research in this thesis will use a longer time-frame of developer experience.
