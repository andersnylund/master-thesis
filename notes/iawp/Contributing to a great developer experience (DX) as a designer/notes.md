# Contributing to a great developer experience (DX) as a designer

- DX plays a big role in a software project success
- when it is neglected, the project is often a failure
- designers can help to create a better DX

## Be open and positive to criticism

- tailor tools and methods to collaboration
- regular feedback sessions
- *"treat developer feedback as user feedback"*
- understand the limit of collaboration, don't push new things too hard

## Teach yourself some code

- try to jump into the shoes of your teammates
  - designers code, coders design
- understanding and learning the role of the team-member is essential of good DX

## Work together with your developers

- being inclusive and good attitude is key
- having sessions where designers collaborate with the developers help to solve issues
- developers can find this approach productive, refreshing and fun
- **appreciation**

## Write motivating and great task descriptions

- clear and well-defined tasks that help developers day-to-day tasks

## Show interest in your team members' work

- social aspect of showing interest towards the developers' work 
- this interest should be about stuff unrelated to the designers work

## Personal thoughts about the text

- the designer, from which viewpoint this article is written from, can be replaced with any other role in a software team
