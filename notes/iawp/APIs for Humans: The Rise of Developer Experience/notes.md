# APIs for Humans: The Rise of Developer Experience (DX)

## Introduction

- UX is a competitive advantage for technology companies
- how to design a good experience for developers?
- use empathy to understand your audience

## What is DX exactly?

- aggregate of all the experience a developer has
- easier to talk about things more concrete like performance, scalability
- generally developers are thought to be intelligent, and therefore there is not that much focus on the experience they are having 

## Experience Matters

- having a good DX will give a huge competitive advantage
- developers time is valuable and should not be wasted
- still, functionality beats usability

## Empathy as a Guiding DX principle

- important to understand that the API designers know the API and all its quirks better than any user, and therefore the API designers has to be able to jump into the shoes of the developer using the API 

## Make Your Users Awesome

- build things with great functionality and usability in order to foster a positive emotional response
- trying to make users love the product and company is the wrong approach
- the products should make the users feel like geniuses

## Creating an Empathic API

- make it easy to understand
  - stripe 
- make your api easier to use
  - low barrier of entry
  - build SDKs
- make your API easy to debug
  - make an API dashboard where every request can be seen 
- make it easy to get help
- don't market to your developer users
  - instead participate in building the community around it

## Why companies fail to create empathic APIs

- Conway's law. If the company designing the API doesn't have a culture of empathy it can't build an empathic API
- too familiar with the API
- not collecting and understanding user feedback

## Personal interpretations from the text

- comparing to a construction site, the tools used there are more standardized and have probably better usability. However, in software developer, the tools used are developed by other developers, and therefore their usability is probably varying quite much
