# Great Developer Experiences and the People Who Make Them

- successful API programs treat developers as a type of customer 
- a traditional company is focusing on their end users or customers
  - however, there might be third party developers that use that traditional company's API to further reach more customers
- two parties: developer and the API team

## The Developer's Experience

- developer's aim to create UX for the users
- developer's don't want trouble by the backend complexity
- Developer portal enables developers to get familiar with the API 
- API in themselves can become the product
  - most commonly the API is just a way of communication that is provided to help create the end product
- demonstrating an experience of a developer finding out, getting to know,  trying out, and using an API to create an application

## The API Product Manager's Experience

- different constituencies of developers?

- Old way of looking at roles in a business
