# Developer Experience: What and Why

http://theappslab.com/2017/04/04/developer-experience-what-and-why/

## Introduction

- trying to raise awareness of DX at Oracle

## What is Developer Experience

- bootstrap, jQuery, braintree were all tools that made implementation simple
  - implementation simplicity
- the tools were engineered to be usable on purpose
- optimize the development process
- Developer Experience is the activity of studying, improving and optimizing how developers get their work done.
- user experience + development principles = dx
- APIs are to developers what the GUIs are to “regular” users

## Why developer experience

### Rise of the cloud

- exclusively offer APIs and leave the development of GUIs over to their consumers
- current expectation is that an application comes with APIs that offer the exact same functionality as the UI, and just like users of our GUIs, developers want these APIs to be simple and easy-to-use.

### Fall of the importance of the UI

- UI-less devices has become more common e.g. Amazon echo
- developers of amazon echo made that platform thrive

## Personal interpretations from the text 

- there is a lot of grey literature on the API and the product's. However, I see that DX is more than that, and talking about APIs is just way to concretize to otherwise abstract concept of DX
