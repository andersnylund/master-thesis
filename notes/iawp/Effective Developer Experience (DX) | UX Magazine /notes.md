# Effective Developer Experience (DX)

https://uxmag.com/articles/effective-developer-experienc

- a platform has a special kind of user: *the third-party developer*
  - intermediary between end users and the platform
- platform product owners must be concerned in assisting developers to create products with good user experience => developer experience

## Trust & communication

- the platform organization has to communicate externally to the developers about their roadmap, so that developers know what and how to prepare
- DX can be thought of as an ecosystem
  - virtuous cycle where a good DX gets more developers to the platform => more developers means more communication that improves the DX

## Education

- docs to explain platform design decisions, explain functionality, policy expectations, conventions
- tutorials and example projects
- peer education
  - community creation

## Tools

- "dogfooding" or "eating your own dog food"
- emulators, simulators, sandboxes and similar tools

## Platform usability

- all previous sections about supporting the development process
- quality and usability of the features provided by the platform
- APIs (not web api's in this case)
- developers need to be trusted

## Together, we can do so much

- successful DX lead to a more successful UX by the creation of value greater than two products independent of each other
