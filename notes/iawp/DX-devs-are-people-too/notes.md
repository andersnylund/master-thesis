## How to build software experiences that developers love

- Tools that developers use are more than often very complex and difficult to use
- design and functionality might be seen as two separate things, but the author argues that they are intertwined
- traditionally, in consumer facing products the design is getting way more care e.g. uber's mobile app. But when targeting developers the focus is often on the functional aspects
- *"developer tools are not made to make things less complicated for engineers"*
- developers tools are often measured by input vs. output
- there should be more points of measure

## DX

- clarity, ease of use, stability, function

## Function

- most important

## Stability

- rectify errors to avoid critical failure

## Ease of use

- easy to navigate
- access things quickly and efficiently
- performance

## Clarity

- intuitive interface
- surfaces critical information, mitigates user error

## Developer are People Too

- a business grade product with zero usability is going to cause huge problems for the user

## Personal thoughts about the text

- The point of view is again about the UX part of a developer using a tool
- Somehow it feels like the IAWPs are just re-explaining the definition of UX
