## Abstract

- UX became a buzzword
- products became not only useful and usable, but also fashionable, fascinating things to desire
- UX is an alternative to HCI
- not too specific about its definite meaning
- special issue on "Empirical studies of the user experience"

## 1. Introduction

- adopted and critiqued at the same time
- vague, elusive, ephemeral
- already in the late 1980s there were articles that discussed that the affective parts of usability are the most important ones
- the authors believe that the lack of empirical research stops advancement of the UX as a concept
- there was a special issue that had the objective to demonstrate the richness of UX research
- the really diverse publications in the issue studied the aspects that go beyond the cognitive task-oriented things
- how will UX research look in the future?
  - proposal to stimulate UX research in the future
- a glance on current literature shows three major perspectives
  1. addressing human needs beyond the instrumental
  2. stresses affective and emotional aspects of the interaction
  3. the nature of experience

## 2. Beyond the instrumental 

- HCI focused on the task at hand
- instrumental value
- beauty was identified as an important quality aspect (Alben 1996)
- surprise, diversion, intimacy (Gaver and Martin 2000)
- both pragmatic and hedonic (Hassenzahl 2003)
- a plethora of questions that could be studied

## 3. Emotion and affect

- affective computing focused more on how computers can sense the emotions and respond according to that
- UX is interested in understanding the role of emotions as a something that happens to the users while using the product
- UX is focused on positive emotions
- prevent frustration and dissatisfaction
- two basic ways to deal with emotions in UX.
  1. emotions as consequences of product use
  2. antecedents of product use  

## 4. The experiental

- situatedness and temporality
- experience is an unique combination of various elements
- experiental outcomes have a more positive impact on one's wellbeing
- complex and unique and therefore outstanding and very difficult to repeat
- "a good product is one that performs without being recognised?"

## 5. Summary and conclusion

- the three different perspectives do not fully capture UX
- "it is driven by commercial vendors, who are sensitive to the changes in business climate"
- HCI = high quality with the absence of problems
- "design for pleasure, rather than absence of pain"

## Personal thoughts about the text

- the article is from 2006, so the term of UX have matured a "little" after that
