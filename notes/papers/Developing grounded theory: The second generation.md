# Developing grounded theory: The second generation

https://www.crcpress.com/rsc/downloads/9781598741933_Corbin.pdf

## Introduction

- Methods change over time
- anyone who writes about a research methodology is going to interpret the method from their own viewpoint
- Strauss has made a big impact on what grounded theory is

## People Change and Methods Change

- the qualitative research resonated because it touches the heart of what nursing is all about
  - making a difference by listening
- in the old days the ideas were
  - that the theory emerges from the data
  - objectivity 
  - avoid going native and remain at distance from participants
  - that research could capture a semblance of "reality"
- Strauss's version of grounded theory has not been abandoned, but it has changed
- the method remains rooter in pragmatism and symbolic interactionism
- some researchers have gone so far to even blur the boundaries between fiction and research
- each project is different and therefore the researchers and the subjects will themselves take their own nuances to the project
- today the author is a pragmatist/interactionist
- there are multiple realities and analysis requires taking into account multiple viewpoints
- events are not the focus, but the meaning that is given to events
- the picture that is created by an individual based by the personal history and biography of the subject can never be understood by the researcher
- constructionist viewpoint is that concepts and theories are constructed
- "knowledge is constantly evolving in light of new experience and findings are 'constructions' and not exact replicas of reality"
  - however "both doing 'interpretive' work and conceptualizing data are necessary because it is necessary to have a language to talk about the phenomena and problems encountered by practitioners in any field"
- conceptual language makes the basis for understanding human response

## Following through on the Challenge

- what even are research methods?
- should there even be a method called grounded theory?
- is theory-constructing research still relevant today?
- the third edition of *basics* had a rough start, but started going well after some time
  - how can computers enhance the research process?

## The Method

- the to be presented method is how Corbin would today approach the research
- Corbin has become much more open when doing analysis
- to demonstrate for the third edition of the book how her methods works, she performed a study and was completely open with the challenges she faced and how she handled the whole research process
  - wanted to perform a research project right in front of the readers
- she chose to study the Vietnam War as she grew up at that time, but didn't know about it that much
- she notes that the researcher has to be excited about the topic
- she didn't have no specific research question in the beginning
- *"I was just going to sit down with that first piece of data in front of me and let it flow, let the research take me where it wanted"*

## Concluding Remarks

## Personal interpretations of the text

- Corbin is a pioneer, and has her background in nursing
- very comprehensive background behind the research philosophy
