# Supporting the Developer Experience with Production Metrics

## Abstract

- utilization of APM (application performance management) produces a lot of data that is not utilized in providing information to developers
- data can be harnessed to enhance the developer experience, and possible tools
- tracing and monitoring services give clues about how the software is behaving in the production environment

## 1 Introduction

## 2 Problem areas

### 2A Exposing execution trees

### 2B Reporting Exceptions

### 2C What is deployed where?

## 3 Related work

## 4 Challenges

### 4A Tracking changes

### 4B Collecting Data

## 5 Research Road Map

- end-to-end toolchain that collets data from web applications, stores it in som metric database, and later shows it in the IDE e.g. JetBrains family
  - collecting metrics in a way that doesn't harm the performance
- can data be presented to the developer when change in the code happens?
- building tools for developer productivity, and therefore the evaluation will be focused around the developer experience
- how does this all affect the everyday life of developer's work
