# The Voice of the Developer

## Introduction

- developers' frustrated comments can be found from code comments and issue trackers
- technical debt and bad code quality results in degrading developer productivity
- the focus has been on the product's and customer's point of view
- the organization "forces" the developer to progress with the product, without negatively impacting the cost and schedule of the product
- *"voice of the developer relates to capturing whether the product enables the developer to achieve the task at hand with reasonable satisfaction and manageable stress and frustration"* 

## Do We Care About Developer Well-Being?

- XP by Kent Beck noted that the 40 hour work week eliminates the expectations set on developers that often in the end result in degrading product quality and accumulates technical debt
- this led to the initiative that software organizations should improve on getting the voice of the developer hard
  - emphasize developer morale and motivation
- instead of thinking about customer and organization satisfaction, there has been a focus of human-factor studies on product quality and developer happiness 
- unhappiness results in lower productivity, but also negative mental state (D. Graziotin 2018)
- *"the impact of the task at hand on developer well-being should be another input when considering system improvement tradeoffs"*

## Expressing the Voice of the Developer

- common vocabulary for the voice of the developer:
  - architecture:
    - more complex architecture makes development more difficult
  - code quality: 
    - not only a function of meeting customer expectations
    - but also a function of keeping a healthy development organization that reflects the voice of the developer
  - technology stack:
    - understanding the learning goals of the developer will allow to meet the expectations of the developer
  - development infrastructure:
    - "an environment that is not well integrated will only add to developers' frustration"
  - incentives to report problems:
    - in the case of deadlines or problems, the voice of the developer is maybe not listened too enough
