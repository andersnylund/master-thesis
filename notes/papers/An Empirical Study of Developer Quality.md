# An Empirical Study of Developer Quality

## Abstract

- developer quality is the rate of non bug-introducing commits
- conclusions
  1. values of developer quality is the same everywhere
  2. DQ increases with software evolution
  3. more contribution => higher DQ
  4. ownership has no correlation with DQ

## 1 Introduction

- predicting and modeling software development is very difficult because of the human factors
- *"every developer have their own coding habits, strong points, interests and easy mistakes to make"*
- measuring developers by some metrics can help to evaluate the performance and productivity of the developer
- **hypothesis: there are many developers with low quality but few developers with high quality**
- high DQ devs should collaborate with low DQ devs
- being longer in the project and making more commits will increase DQ

## 2 Preliminaries

- 

### 2A Developer Quality

- previous metrics on developers are based on the code committing behaviors
- based on the commits in the git repositories the feature and fix commits can be counted
- 

### 2B Developer Contribution

### 2C Ownership

### 5C Future Work

## 7 Conclusions

## Personal thoughts about the text

- I don't know if I like the beginning of this 
- project managers are objectifying developers ðŸ¤”
