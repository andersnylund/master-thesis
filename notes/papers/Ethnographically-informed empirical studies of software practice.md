# Ethnographically-informed empirical studies of software practice

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584907000110

## Abstract

- qualitative studies of software development practice on and social factors
- the advantages and challenges associated with being a member of the community under study
- how to maintain rigour in data collection

## 1. Introduction

- for the most part research in software engineering has focused on quantitative analysis

### 1.1. Ethnographically-informed studies

- the studies carried out by the authors have given insights into the social dimensions of software development
- all studies ethnographically informed in two particulars
  1. not hypothesis drive research, but instead research question driven
  2. we avoid all form of control
- traditionally ethnography have been about immersing into the community for several months, even years
- researchers in this study have used shorter time frame with help semi-structured interviews, studying practice artefacts, and serendipitous observation

### 1.2 An illustration of our approach

- the researchers have taken an approach of looking at everything as "strange", without trying to understand why something is happening e.g. with the XP task board
- this helps to reveal things that would otherwise go unnoticed when studying the phenomena from the lens of a software engineer

## 2. Our qualitative studies

## 3. Research questions

## 4. Methodological and practical challenges

## 5. The nature of our research findings

### 5.1 Problems and solutions

- instead of going out with a specific problem (and solution) in mind, the problems and solutions arose from the data

### 5.2 Challenging received views

- 

## 6. The impact of our research

## 7. Concluding remarks

## Personal interpretations of the text

- will this study give any value to my own thesis?
- the 4 areas of study are not directly relevant to this study
- somewhat complex language used
