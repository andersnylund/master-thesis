# Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies for Distributed HCI Design

## Abstract

- Chainstorming: online communication brainstorming
- Cheatstorming: previously generated brainstorm ideas are delivered to targeted local contexts in response to a prompt
- Suggestion, that ideation need not require the generation of new ideas
- Brains is more than the pooling of "invented" ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways

## INTRODUCTION

- design-driven study with the aim of improving ideation in distributed HCI projects

### Brainstorming Effectiveness as an Ideation Technique

- three main steps in brainstorming
  1. fact-finding
  2. idea-finding
  3. solution-finding
- there has been some criticism of brainstorming

### Limitations of Brainstorming

### Structuring Ideation: Three Approaches Defined

## METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN RESEARCH

### Opportunity finding

### Electronic Brainstorming

### Concept Selection and Refinement

### Experimentation: Cheatstorming (Study 1)

- Instead of always generating new ideas, the previously generated ideas can be used when evaluating a prompt question
-  

### Experimentation: Cheatstorming (Study 2)

## DISCUSSION

### Findings: Process

### Findings: Results

## CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK: CHAINSTORMING, TWEETSTORMING, AND CHEATSTORMING AT SCALE

- different stages of the model presented:
  1. prompting, the stage during which the ideation facilitator presents a challenge to the group that will drive ideation
  2. sharing, the stage in which participants suggest and communicate ideas within the context of the medium that frame activity
  3. selecting, the phase during which participants vote and/or otherwise determine their favorite ideas
  4. committing, the stage at which a final criterion is set to evaluate and prioritize ideas
- *Even in traditional brainstorming sessions, we propose, it is this communicative interplay between one person’s conception of an idea and another's (mis)interpretation that results in the so-called “generation” of ideas*
