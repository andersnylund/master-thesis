Kitchenham B. A. and Charters S. 2007. Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering. Version 2.3, EBSE Technical Report, EBSE- 2007-01, Keele University.

## 1. What is Introduction

- Aimed towards researchers and PhD students 
- It discusses the difference of SE and medical research

### 1.4 What is how to use the guidelines

- *Readers who are unsure about what a systematic literature review is should start by reading Section 2.*

## 2. What is Systematic Literature Reviews

- "Primary studies" are the studies that are referenced in the SLR
- secondary studies are the SLRs and MLRs

### 2.1 What is Reasons for performing systematic literature reviews

- summarizing existing evidence
- identify gaps and suggest further investigation
- provide a framework for new research
- examine if empirical evidence supports/contradicts theoretical hypotheses
- assist the generation of new hypotheses

### 2.2 What is The importance of systematic literature reviews

- all research start with some kind of literature review. SLRs make this step more defined and often requires the researchers to show both supporting and contradicting literature regarding their own research problem or hypotheses
- *"Systematic literature reviews in all disciplines allow us to stand on the shoulders of giants and in computing, allow us to get off each others’ feet."*

### 2.3 What is Advantages and disadvantages

- well-defined methodology to review literature
- provide information about the effects of some phenomenon
- allows to combine data using meta-analytics techniques

### 2.4 What is features of systematic literature reviews

- review protocol
- based on a defined search strategy
- document the search strategy
- require explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria of the primary studies
- prerequisite for quantitative meta-analysis

## 2.5 What is other types of review

### 2.5.1 What is Systematic mapping studies

- if there is very little evidence or the topic is very broad
- allows to plot the evidence at a high level of granularity
- allows identification of evidence clusters and evidence deserts to direct the focus on future systematic reviews and primary studies

### 2.5.2 What is Tertiary reviews

- systematic review of systematic reviews
- not that heavy as a normal systematic review

## 3. What is Evidence based software engineering in context

- *"software engineering is significantly different from the traditional medical arena in which systematic reviews were first developed."*

## 4. What is The review process

- all stages are mandatory except: commissioning a review, evaluating the review protocol, evaluating the report
- the stages require iteration

## 5. What is Planning

- define the research question(s)
- review protocol (plan)

### 5.1 The need for a systematic review

- summarise all existing information about some phenomenon in a thorough and unbiased manner
- has there been previous systematic reviews
- DARE
- **read more about the example of DARE**

### 5.2 What is Commissioning a review

- not important in a research undertaking own needs

### 5.3 What is The Research Question(s)

- search process must identify primary studies
- data extraction must answers the questions
- data analysis must synthesise the data so the questions can be answered

#### 5.3.1 What is Questions types

- the right questions are:
  - meaningful and important to both practitioners and researchers
  - will lead to either to changes in current practices or give confidence that the current practices are correct
  - will identify discrepancies between commonly held beliefs and reality
- *"a systematic review in a PhD thesis should identify the existing basis for the research student’s work and make it clear where the proposed research fits into the current body of knowledge"*

#### 5.3.2 What is Question structure

- population
  - software engineering role: testers, managers
  - category of software engineer: novice or experienced
  - application area: IT system, command and control systems
  - industry group: small IT companies, telecommunication companies
- intervention
  - software methodology/tool/technology/procedure that addresses a specific issue
- comparison
  - software methodology/tool/technology/procedure with which the intervention is being compared
- outcomes
  - improved reliability, reduced production costs, reduced time to market
- context
  - e.g. academia or industry, practitioners or academics, small scale or large scale
  - in software engineering the studies might be limited, and therefore there is no possibility to pick things from the primary studies
- experimental designs
  - *"In medical studies, researchers may be able to restrict systematic reviews to primary studies of one particular type"*

### 5.4 What is Developing a review protocol

- without a protocol, the researcher(s) could be biased and make the selections based on that
- the protocol (plan) includes:
  - rationale for the survey
  - research questions
  - strategy for finding primary studies including search terms and resources
  - study selection criteria. Pilot the initial selection criterions on a subset of primary studies 
  - study selection procedures. How many assessors will evaluate each possible primary study and how disagreements will be solved
  - study quality assessment checklists and procedures. 
  - data extraction strategy. How the information required from each primary study will be obtained
  - synthesis of the extracted data. Whether or not a formal meta-analysis is intended and if so what techniques will be used

### 5.5 What is Evaluating a Review protocol

- *"PhD students should present their protocol to their supervisors for review and criticism."*
- search strings are derived from the research questions
- data to be extracted will properly address the research question(s)
- data analysis helps to answer the 
- **what is the difference between addressing and answering?**

### 5.6 What is Lessons learned for protocol construction

- pre-review mapping may help in scoping research questions
- revise questions as the understanding of the problem increases
- the whole systematic review team has to understand the whole process
- piloting the research protocol is essential 
- recommendation is to limit the scope of a SLR by choosing clear and narrow research questions

## 6. What is Conducting the review

- all these steps should already be tested when creating the protocol to assure that the direction is right

### 6.1 What is Identification of research

- *"find as many primary studies relating to the research question as possible using an unbiased search strategy"*
- rigour differentiates a SLR from a normal review

#### 6.1.1 What is Generating a search strategy

- search strategies are
  - identify existing systematic reviews assess the volume of potential primary studies
  - trial searches using various combinations of search terms
  - checking trial research strings against list of already known primary studies
  - consult experts
- break down the questions into facets (look at Section 5.3.2)
- create sophisticated search strings with boolean ANDs and ORs
- look also at the grey literature
- if there is little research on the particular topic, it might be necessary to look at other research in related disciplines e.g. group working practices

#### 6.1.2 What is Publication Bias

- Some organizations who sponsors some research of course wants positive results
- publication bias can lead to systematic bias 

#### 6.1.3 What is Bibliography management and document retrieval

- Reference Manager or Endnote might help in managing the documents

#### 6.1.4 What is Documenting the Search

- SLR must be transparent and replicable
- readers must be able to assess the thoroughness
- search should be documented
- unfiltered search results should be saved
- Table 2 shows what information of each different type of source material should be saved
- specify the rationale for digital libraries to be searched

#### 6.1.5 What is Lessons learned for Search Procedures

- several issues when specifying electronic search procedures:
  - knowing the publication date of first paper can help in restricting
  - no single source finds all primary studies
  - current software engineering search engines don't support SLRs
- list of possible sources includes IEEExplore, ACM, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Inspec, Citeseer, SpringerLink, Scopus
- look at the example on page 18 on how to construct the search words

### 6.2 What is study selection

#### 6.2.1 What is study selection criteria

- identify those primary studies that provide direct evidence about the research question
- selection criteria should be defined when making the protocol to avoid bias, may be refined during the process
- avoid selection based on the language of the primary study
- masking the origin of primary studies does not improve reviews

#### 6.2.2 What is Study selection process

- *"recommend maintaining a list of excluded papers, only after the totally irrelevant papers have been excluded, in particular, maintaining a record of those candidate primary studies that are excluded as a result of the more detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria."*

#### 6.2.3 What is Reliability of inclusion decisions

- inclusion decisions should be revisited and assessed by some outsider
- individual researchers can also take a test-retest approach
  - **find out what this means**

### 6.3 What is study quality assessment

- assess the quality of primary studies
  - more detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria
  - to investigate whether quality differences provide an explanation for differences in study results
  - weighting the importance of individual studies
  - guide the interpretation of findings
  - to guide recommendations for further research
- table 3 shows the quality concept definitions

#### 6.3.1 What is the hierarchy of evidence

- Randomised and controller experiments and systematic reviews are higher on the rank of evidence than what e.g. expert opinions are
- we should select studies that suite the specific research question that we have
- a lot of studies in software engineering are correlation studies e.g. if we do this, will that happen?

#### 6.3.2 What is Development of Quality Instruments

- It is impossible to do "blinding" in software engineering
- table 4 **???**
- table 5 shows a quality checklist for quantitative studies
- table 6 shows a quality checklist for qualitative studies

#### 6.3.3 What is using the quality instrument

- quality data can be used to
  - assist primary study selection. Quality data must be collected separate to main data collection
  - assist data analysis and synthesis
- **how important is it in a master thesis to assess the quality of the studies?**
- quality score can be used to investigate whether the results of the primary study were associated with study quality

#### 6.3.4 What is Limitations of Quality Assessment

- Researchers should attempt to get more information from the authors if there is something missing
- quality checklists should address methodological quality, and not reporting quality
- original data should always be available, so that readers can take a look at them
- data might be confidential, and some researchers might even want to keep it to themselves

### 6.4 What is Data Extraction

- data extraction forms should be defined and piloted when the study protocol is defined

#### 6.4.1 What is design of data extraction forms

- if the quality criteria is used for inclusion/exclusion, the quality data and main data should be on separate forms
- if quality criteria is part of the data analysis, all data can be in the same form
- **in this case both of the can be in the same form, or?**
- numerical data is a must
- data extraction forms need to be piloted on a sample of primary studies
- pilot studies assess technical issues and completes

#### 6.4.2 What is Contents of data collections forms

- all the questions needed to answer and
  - name of the reviewer 
  - date of data extraction
  - title, authors, journal, publication details
  - space for additional notes

#### 6.4.3 What is Data extraction procedures

- Data extraction should be done independently
- possible disagreements must be resolved
- PhD supervisors could perform data extraction on a random sample of primary studies
- test-retest to check data extraction consistency

#### 6.4.4 What is multiple publications of the same data

- primary studies must not use the same original data
- the most complete publication of the same data should be used 

### 6.4.5 What is unpublished data, missing data and data requiring manipulation

- unpublished data can be used but must be used with care and permission
  
### 6.4.6 What is lessons learned about Data Extraction

- one reader as data extractor and another as a data checker when large amount of papers
- review team must understand the protocol and the data extraction process

### 6.5 What is Data Synthesis

- descriptive (non-quantitative)
- quantitative summary
- meta-analysis is obtaining quantitative synthesis with statistical techniques
- data synthesis activities should be in the review protocol

#### 6.5.1 What is descriptive (narrative) synthesis

- tables should be constructed so that similarity and difference between studies are apparent
- if studies are consistent (homogenous) or inconsistent (heterogenous) with each other must be stated in the synthesis

#### 6.5.2 What is quantitative synthesis

- **this is not needed in this master thesis???**

#### 6.5.3 What is presentation of quantitative results

- **this is not needed in this master thesis???**

#### 6.5.4 What is Qualitative synthesis

- trying to integrate studies comprising natural language results and conclusions
- terms and concepts can subtly or grossly have different meanings
- three approaches for qualitative synthesis
  - Reciprocal translation. when studies are about similar things, and the aim is to create an additional summary
  - Refutational Synthesis. when studies are trying to prove something wrong
  - Line of argument synthesis. This is when researchers are trying to understand a whole concept from studies that are just looking at a sub-part of it. First each study is analysed, and then an attempt to analyse them as a whole. 

#### 6.5.5 What is synthesis if qualitative and quantitative studies

- **this is not needed in this master thesis???**

#### 6.5.6 What is sensitivity analysis

- results of the analysis should be repeated on various subsets of primary studies

#### 6.5.7 What is publication bias

- i don't know

#### 6.5.8 What is Lessons learned about data synthesis

- with funnel plots it is possible to show if the review is vulnerable to publication bias

## 7. What is Reporting the review (dissemination)

### 7.1 What is Specifying the Dissemination Strategy

- often the reviews are aimed to be published in conferences and/or journals

### 7.2 What is Formatting the Main Systematic Review Report

- if the report of the review is too short, it should be also somehow indicate the whole study in some more technical way
- table 8 shows what should be included in the report

### 7.3 What is Evaluating systematic review reports

- the report should be peer-reviewed

### 7.4 What is lessons learned about reporting systematic literature reviews

- review teams must keep a detailed record of the decisions made during the review process
- more standard ways to conduct SLR in software engineering is required, especially with the 
- any deviations from the protocol must be documented

## 8. What is Systematic mapping studies

- provide wide coverage of the research area
- shows if research exists on a topic
- quantity of the publications
- main difference to SLRs
  - mapping studies have broader research questions driving them and often ask multiple RQs
  - less focused search terms
  - data extraction is broader, more like a classification and categorisation
  - analysis stage of a mapping study is about summarising the data to answer the research questions posed

## 9. What is Final remarks

- PhD students and larger research groups should use these guidelines
- most important if alone
  - develop a protocol
  - define the research question
  - specify how the problem of one person doing all work will be solved
    - **how?**
  - define search strategy
  - define data to be extracted
  - maintain list of included and excluded studies
  - use data synthesis guidelines
  - use report guidelines
- 

## Personal thoughts about the paper

- Very well written paper that is easy to ready, but quite long
- Think about the MLR guidelines paper
- Use the SLR on "programming experience" as the basis and example to this study
- They are taking the medical guidelines as the basis to there SE guidelines
  - I don't know if all this is relevant
- take a look at appendix 3 to get an example of a review protocol
