- the example of this is taken from the 3d printing platform "Thingiverse"

- innovators are doing what they do just for the sheer excitement or enjoyment of building things
- there is a missed opportunity to not allow innovators to share their creations 
- pre-innovation platform is the digital service that allows sharing the innovations and creations
- member on 3D printing platforms can easily exchange comments on other members' work, as well as share and further develop designs in the form of digital files
- 

### 3.1 Pre-innovation platform activities and innovation diffusion success

- being an active member on a pre-innovation platform enables the understanding of the value of detailed instructions of innovations and creations

## Personal interpretations from the text

- who is a consumer?
