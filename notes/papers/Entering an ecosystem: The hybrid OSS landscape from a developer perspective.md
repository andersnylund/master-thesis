# Entering an ecosystem: The hybrid OSS landscape from a developer perspective

## Abstract

- Hybrid OSS are virtual organizations
- each community has their own way of working affecting contributions, verifications, long-term decisions
- this is a challenging environment for new developers

## 1. Introduction

- a Hybrid OSS consists of both individual developers and representatives of companies (think of React and Facebook)
- ensuring that everyone has equal rights and opportunities is key for collaboration and motivation
- *connection in between the community context and the developer's experience have largely been unexplored*
- the aim is to lay ground for understanding on how communities can be made more welcoming for new developers

## 2. The community context

- Onion model
  - in the middle the core developers and project leaders
  - second layer co-developers
  - exterior layer of passive users and bug reporters not being in touch with the source code
  - new contributors should go through each layer to proceed towards the core 
- today businesses ("community sponsor") are building their products with the OSS model, which then changes the system
  - commercial actors don't have to behave like the rest of the community and can make shortcuts etc.
- community sponsors can manage and orchestrate the whole project
- a community has to stay healthy
- Governance is crucial in a Hybrid OSS

### 2.1 A focus on the developer

- healthy community should provide reward and motivation for further contribution
- in Hybrid OSS discussion can be outside of the reach of the individual developer, which can hamper contribution
- mentoring new developers and providing them the necessary information 

## 3 Modeling the context

### 3.1 The example application

## 4 Discussion and Summary

- there is some questioning around if the Bronfenbrenner's model can be applied from human development to software development. However there are similarities
  - learning the community, ways of working, and socio-cultural value systems
- the research raises possible new research questions
