# The need for multivocal literature reviews in software engineering: complementing systematic literature reviews with grey literature

https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2916008

## What is Abstract

- SLR do not show the state of the practice, as they are not considering the "grey" literature
- Questions to be answered
  1. What types of knowledge are missed when a SLR does not include the multivocal literature in a SE field?
  2. What do we, as a community, gain when we include the multivocal literature and conduct MLRs?
- The study identifies the missing and gained knowledge when conducting MLR
- Answers:
  1. Grey literature can give substantial benefits in certain areas of SE
  2. the inclusion of grey literature brings forward certain challenges as evidence in them is often experience and opinion based

## 1. What is Introduction

- **What is Systematic Mapping?**
- The practitioners are constantly producing material, but this state of the practice is not addressed as it is considered as "grey" literature
- Software engineering is a practice oriented field, and therefore it is important to address both the state-fo-the-art and state-of-the-practice
- Large majority of software practitioners do not publish in academic forums -> a lot of information is not addressed, even if it is up to date and "state-of-the-practice"
- *"another potential use of multivocal literature reviews is in closing the gap between academic research and professional practice"*
- **Are the already done MLRs to be found anywhere?**

## 2. What is Background and related work

### 2.1 MLRs in other fields

- There as been discussion about MLR and its challenges and advantages

### 2.2 MLRs in SE

- New topic that just recently in the past decade has gotten traction
- There's been a MSc thesis about grey literature

## 3. What is Goal, research questions, and methodology

## 4. What is Results

## 5. What is Discussions

### 5.1 What is implications, recommendations, and open issues

- Research is focused on empirical studies by e.g. surveys, semi-structured interviews to understand the practitioners' voice. 
- But the majority of information is already available online
- **There is a table with questions that indicates if grey literature should be included**
- There are implications with using grey literature
- Future guidelines are going to be presented about how to conduct MLR

### 5.2 What is Limitations and threats to validity

- **Some explanations on why the methods selected works**

## 6. What is conclusions and future works

- Future work is: *develop guidelines for conducting MLRs in SE, conducting more MLRs, assessing the industrial usefulness of MLRs by asking our industry partners to read and evaluate them* 

## Interpretations from the text

## Personal thoughts about the text

- Because everyone can post anything anywhere on the internet now, there is a lot of information that is on the grey area. This wasn't a problem before because all published writing required a more rigorous process to get published
