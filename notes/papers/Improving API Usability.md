## Abstract

- APIs (libraries, frameworks, toolkits, SDKs) are use by all code
- if everything is included each line of code will call some sort of API
- APIs enable code reuse
- 15000 listed web APIs in programmable web

## Introduction

- Apigee's surveys of large companies reports that 77% of respondents says that APIs are important
- APIs are difficult to use
- incorrect usage has consequences
- design of the API can make it unusable
- techniques and principles from HCI can be used to improve usability
- human centered techniques can be used to determine the requirements so the API provides the right requirements
- software patterns in APIs can be problematic
- usability of the API should be an explicit design-and-evaluation criteria
  - lowering the usability should be an action that is done knowingly
- there was some interest in API usability in late 1990s
- microsoft created www.apiusability.org in 2009
- stakeholders
  - API designers including everyone creating the api like implementors and document writers
    - goals: maximize adoption, minimize costs, and release on time
  - API users or programmers that use APIs
    - goals: quickly write error-free programs, no need to limit scope, use mainstream APIs, backwards compatibility, quick and efficient applications
  - Consumers that use the resulting products
    - goals: desired features, robustness, and ease of use of products

## Motivating the Problem

## Examples of Problems

## Human-Centered Methods

## Evaluating the API Design

## Mitigations

## Tools

## Conclusion

- since the start of the research theres been big changes in the software industry
- agile has improved, and it enables to create products that are based on user feedback
- users have it easier to adapt to changes than what code has
  - => the design of the API should be good already from the beginning
- not clear how "fail fast, fail often" is applicable to API design
- usability should be metric of an API like every other metric related to APIs

## Personal interpretations from the text

- they are using UX and DX analogously, which makes it problematic
- they don't state who exactly the DX is concerning
- interesting article that should be read thoroughly
