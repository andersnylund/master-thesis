# Software Developers as Users: Developer Experience of a Cross-Platform Integrated Development Environment

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-26844-6_40

## What is Abstract

- Software development is complex, both technically and socially
- Developer Experience is a topic that is grossly under-researched
- Software developers face challenges
- Developers are users of development tools, e.g. integrated development environments

## What is Introduction

- IDEs help developers in many things:
  - decreasing the errors
  - increasing speed
  - create new code
  - fix defects
  - supports task switching and recall
  - writing the program
  - enables deep concentration
- Developers are not seen as users of development tools
- Interesting that developers are users and designers at the same time: *"Developers should be also able to understand the human user to be able to fulfill their needs with the software under development"*
- This paper talks about Developer Experience in the sense of UX

## What is Background

- UX is difficult to define, is ambiguous and there are many variants of it
- Early HCI (Human Computer Interaction) focused on work-related studies, the current UX studies are focusing more on consumers and leisure systems.

## What is Methods and Participants

- Survey sent to experienced developers

## What is Results

- The IDE was seen as fast
- No unnecessary features and well designed
- Should be more stable
- Could cause interruptions in the workflow

## What is Discussion

- IDE should let the developer be in control
- *"Responses concentrated mostly on pragmatic qualities of the IDE instead of the hedonic"*
  - Hedonic = relating to, characterized by, or considered in terms of pleasant (or unpleasant) sensations.
  - Pragmatic = dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations.
- The components of flow state are
  - "perceived challenge-skill balance"
  - person's ability to act spontaneously and automatically
  - getting unambiguous feedback
  - sense of being in control
  -  transformation of time
  -  feeling that the experience is highly rewarding
- The reflections made in the study are highly speculative

## What is Future Work

- The authors want to continue studying in the same area
- Aim to enable creation of tools that help developers to focus

## What is Conclusions

- The results show that developers appreciate flexibility, information, intuition and reliability.
 
 - The paper was presented 2-4.12.2015, and therefore is including the most novel articles, but not the most recent ones
- The responses were mainly pragmatic things about the IDE, but not hedonic
- Some developers explained that their IDE made them feel home and created a friendly atmosphere
- It is very important to look at the timeline of the articles as it reveals at what stage of the definition of Developer Experience  
- How were the surveys done in the paper?
  - Were they done online?
- It is ok to cite the same source, one sentence after the other as in this paper
- Interesting finding that the responses were mainly pragmatic, and not hedonic. This could show that 
- As the responses were mainly pragmatic shows that software developers are not feeling based, but think more logically about things. This can also explain
- Flow state in the article is something that is wanted to be achieved. However I would say that the flow state might be considered harmful **(search up the article arguing this)**
- Interesting research question: *"the interplay of how to support developer collaboration without disturbing the developer flow"*
- Interesting thing I've myself noticed are developers not wanting to be around other developers, as they get disturbed and can't get into the flow state. 
- Current UX is probably concentrated on making products as addictive as possible
- Different citation styles can be combined.
  - Both in text, and after a sentence. 
- The respondents were quite experienced with an average of 13,5 year working experience
