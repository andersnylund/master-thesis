https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2664372

## Abstract

- User experience captures the feelings of using products, systems, and services
- DX captures how developers thing and feel about their activities within their working environments
- Assumption: improvement of DX has positive impact on team and project performance

## 1 Introduction

- human factors the most important in software development
- tools and methods only amplify the productivity of highly skilled and well-coordinated development teams
- flaws in communication and collaboration will lead to failure
- the concept of DX in this paper abstracts away the quantity of human characteristics
- **aim to help practitioner better understand, analyze, design, and improve project environments from the point of view of developers**

## 2 Related approaches

- user experience, customer experience, brand experience
- models for high-performing teams 
- creating experience
- experiencing vs an experience
- co-experience, shared experience, group experience
- customer experience can be a longer time intervall, or just one transaction => both product and service
- models for high-performing teams are complex
- motivator factors
- hygiene factors
- affects performance
  1. task characteristics
  2. self-development
  3. material and safety factors
- simulation modeling tries to to abstract some specific part of software development
- experience design tries to improve the user experience but focuses less on the functionality

## 3 Developer experience 

- experience = involvement
- 

## 4 Ongoing and future work

- First study has started that focuses on industry's understanding of DX
  - what are the differences in roles, project settings, cultures
