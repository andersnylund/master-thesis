# Rapid ethnography: time deepening strategies for HCI field research

## Introduction?

- These methods can be used in gathering simple requirements to evaluating of new series
- Misunderstood as simple data collection 
  - is in fact transcribing the users in multiple ways
- Effective realization of context of use	
- Helps eliciting hard to articulate requirements
- Challenging to spend time on the field
- Traditional ethnography takes months to perform
- Different approaches to minimize time required to perform ethnography
- RAP is a rapid version of ethnography used in medical research.
  - Team of researchers instead of single researcher
- This paper is a an adoption of the RAP approach
	
## Focus and key informants?

- Often ethnography is done by taking note of everything that happens, as at the time it might be unknown what is valuable and what is not
- Noting everything might remove the need to revisit the field
- Wide-lens approach causes critical data to go unnoticed.
- This papers approach can be compared to a telephoto lens = focused and a close look of the subject
- what characteristics of the existing (manual) system should be automated, which activities should remain manual, and which activities should be replicated without change in an automated system.
- Field guide
- Liminal
- Corporate
- Fringe	
	
## Interactive observations?

- Division of labor, the more the better
- Use the time wisely
- Interactivity as interviews, activity walkthroughs, contextual inquiry and group elicitation techniques
- Participant observation

## Collaborative data analysis?

- Typical analysis of data is slow, use computer-assisted or collaborative data analysis
- ratio of AT to ST
- Collaborative understanding of the data
- Cognitive mapping, pictorial story telling and scenario analysis
	
## the case study?

- How Internet change the way people work
- Resulted data: interview notes, work process flowcharts, floor plans and photographs of the work environment and work processes, paper artifacts, forms, brochures, web documents	

## Focusing on the observation and key informants?

- Focus on technology pioneers
- Companies that use internet to conduct critical business
- Three aspects: forms of communication, artifacts to support communication, aspects of the physical work environment as office arrangements
- How does online publishing and paper publishing groups differ from their offices?
		
## interactive observations?
	
- Two or three persons for each organization
- Observing of online communication of a news group
- Researchers created their own "chat" where the same problems appeared as the informants told
- Informants created maps to actively tell their experiences with Internet		

## Understanding field data?

- After each visit questionnaires were answered and models created. 
- Gaps in individual learning of researchers were filled by other researchers learning	

## Summary and related work?

- Nothing new

## Interpretations from text

- This article is about HCI, not User-centered design which must be thought of when reading the text
- Ethnography requires time, so the use of it in HCI and User-centered design is limited
- The paper lists "helpful" ideas that for me weren't familiar before, but one could think that they - would have been implicit 
- Techniques remind of the paper were contextual inquiry was used
- Old paper which case study researched the use of Internet. This could be compared to a new technology today which quite yet has not gotten ground in working environments, but has huge potential. E.g. VR or
