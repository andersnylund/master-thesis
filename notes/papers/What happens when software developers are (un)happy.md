# What happens when software developers are (un)happy

## Abstract

- Understanding happiness and unhappiness can give cost-effective ways of enhancing working conditions, job performance
- happiness and unhappiness in all its components - positive and negative emotions and moods
- 

## 1. Introduction

- focus on previous research has been on happiness
- previous papers have focused on the unhappiness
- this paper focuses more on the experienced consequences on both happiness and unhappiness
- objective happiness can be construed as the difference between experienced positive affect and experienced negative affect
- "what software developers consider to happen when they experience happiness or unhappiness"
- 

## 2. Background and related work

### 2.1. Theory of affect and happiness

- Affect is widely agreed to be “a neurophysiological state that is consciously accessible as a simple, non-reflective feeling that is an integral blend of hedonic (pleasure – displeasure) and arousal (sleepy – activated) values”
- Frequent positive (negative) experiential episodes lead to feeling frequent positive (negative) affect, leading to happiness (unhappiness) represented by a positive (negative) affect balance

### 2.2. Affect and happiness in software engineering research

## 3. Method

- The overall research project employs a mixed research method, with elements of both quantitative and qualitative research
- all studies share the same general theme and use the same data sample, but have different scopes, variables, and designs
- purely qualitative

### 3.1. Sampling strategy

### 3.2. Survey design

### 3.2. Survey design

## 4. Results

### 4.1. Descriptive statistics

### 4.2. Internal consequences—Developer’s own being

### 4.3. External consequences—Process

### 4.4. External consequences—Artifact-oriented

### 4.5. Internal consequences—Developer’s own being

### 4.6. External consequences—Process

### 4.7. External consequences—Artifact-oriented

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1. Addressing the research questions

### 5.2. Limitations

### 5.3. Recommendations for practitioners

### 5.4. Implications for researchers

## 6. Conclusion

- internal: developer's own being
- external: process and artifact
- biggest impact of mood is on cognitive performance like creativity and flow
- happiness benefits themselves and unhappiness more as being detrimental to others

## Personal thoughts about the text
