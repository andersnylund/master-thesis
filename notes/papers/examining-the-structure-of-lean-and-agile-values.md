# Examining the Structure of Lean and Agile Values Among Software Developers

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06862-6_15

## Abstract

- to get as much as possible out from lean and agile there has to be an understanding of the culture, mindset and values
- lean and agile values of software developers are connected, but not equal to universal values

## 1 Introduction

- diversity in personal values can lead to conflict
- a shared professional culture can help overcoming individual differences
- "mushy" stuff of values and culture
- previous studies measuring leanness and agility resulted in checklists of methodological procedures 

## 2 Related Work

## 3 Research design and execution

## 4 Analysis and Results

- a narrow work focus
- flexibility in task execution in leadership
- planning and preparation
- adherence to the process
- discipline
- reliance on people
- freedom to organise
- sense of purpose
- predictability and justification
- collaboration
- broad stakeholder involvement

## 5 Discussion and Limitations

- the values are a mix of human aspects, process, and the meaning of work

## 6 Conclusions and Future Work

- *practitioners can benefit from making implicit values more explicit in their work*
- by not specifying actions to specific situations, and instead using a value-based approach it can be easier to react to new unforeseen situations
- instead of talking about methodological practices, the value system could be used for communication
