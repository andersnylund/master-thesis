https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7965359

## What is Abstract

- "Happy-productive" thesis
- Based on the literature, fostering happiness can be done by limiting unhappiness
- Before this paper, the possible negative effects of unhappiness were still unknown
- Study found 49 potential things that can be affected by unhappy developers
- This study raises awareness of the role of moods, emotions and feelings

## What is Introduction

- Much study has been made on how happy developers generally affect, but there has been little focus on how unhappy developers affect
- It has been reported that happiness is the sum of the positive and negative experiences
- The authors are doing a doing a bigger study on how developers and their emotions are affecting the software development

## What is Method

## What is Results

- The questionnaire was answered by mostly developers born 84
- **What does the "254 codes" mean?**

## What is Discussion and Conclusion

- Highest impact of unhappy developers is on productivity and performance
- Mental health problems is also caused by unhappiness
- Low motivation
- Shortcuts become more acceptable => low quality code
- *"Intervening on the affect of developers might have relatively low cost but astonishing benefits"* [D. Graziotin, X. Wang, and P. Abrahamsson, “How do you feel,developer? An explanatory theory of the impact of affects on programming  performance,”PeerJ Computer Science,  vol.  1,no. 1, p. e18, Aug. 2015] **Look this up. What is meant by relatively low cost?**
- Limiting unhappiness of developers will limit the negative consequences to the developers themselves and the projects

## Interpretations from the text

- There has been a lot of research already on the emotions of developers in the context of software development
- Many studies have been done on the relation between affect and performance

## Personal thoughts about the text

- It is apparent that companies want to keep their developers happy
  - This can be seen from investments in team-events, offices, laptops, learning material, 
  - For me personally it sometimes feels like it's a waste of resources, and I'm constantly amazed about how much companies are ready to spend on these "small, un-important" things
- Interesting that they used data from GitHub to create the questionnaire
