## Abstract

- domain-specific modeling language (DSMLs)
- the usability of languages are thought in an ad-hoc way
- multi-agent system (MAS)
- the adoptability of these DSML is dependent on the usability
- the improved version was perceived significantly improved in terms of icons comprehensibility, adequacy, and usability
- users were however not more efficient or effective

## 1 Introduction

- Usability of the DSML has to meet developer expectations
- in this study the visual notation of a language was improved

## 2 SEA_ML

## 3 Physics of Notations

## 4 Applying Physics of Notations Principles to SEA_ML

## 5 Evaluation

## 6 Related Work

## 7 Conclusion and Future Work

- 9 principles, 43 notation from The physics of Notations were used
- research goal was comprehensiveness, usability, effectiveness, and efficiency

## Personal interpretations from the text

- interesting how this paper refers to DX only using principles of UX, but it still is a modeling language and therefore it's about DX
- fagerholm's doctoral thesis noted something like "Without using the framework presented, a study of usage of an IDE would probably only focus on the usability and cognitive parts of the IDE, while the developer experience study would also consider more than that (incl. affective and conative)"*
