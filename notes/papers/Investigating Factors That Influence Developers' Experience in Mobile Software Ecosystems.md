# Investigating factors that influence developers' experience in mobile software ecosystems

## Abstract

- Keystone software organization are fighting for application developers
- Providing a good DX is a big part of this the fight of developers

## 1. Introduction

- Apple, Google, and Microsoft
- **Do they mean that software developers should be able to publish apps only within the team?**
- *"DX is related to the experiences related to the developerâ€™s interactions during software development"*
- *"In MSECOs, DX can help understand the expectations, perceptions and feelings concerning the onboarding and engagement of developers"*
- systematic methodology for literature review called snowballing and thematic analysis

## 2. Background

- *"DX consists of the experiences related to all kinds of artifacts and activities that a developer can find as part of his/her participation in software development"*
- keystone has to provide a framework that enables developers expanding the MSECO frontiers
- developer has to create and deliver reach the niches of users
- the star ratings in the app store

## 3. Study Design and Execution

- *"As inclusion criteria, we defined: (1) Peer-reviewed papers in conferences or journals related to Developer Experience and Software Ecosystems, and; (2) Papers written in English. If a paper did not attend one of these criteria, it was excluded."*

## 4. The identification of DX influence factors in mobile software ecosystems

- They used a mind map to summarize, integrate, combine, and compare the findings
- Thematic analysis was performed with the following steps:
  1. read data to become familiar with patterns
  2. generate initial codes
  3. combine codes into themes
  4. find out how themes support data 
  5. define what each theme is 
  6. which themes make meaningful contribution

### 4.A Development infrastructure

- developer expectations might remain unarticulated or only vaguely expressed
- growing sophistication of users is leading to higher users' expectations of systems
- in MSECO's, developer expectations can influence their selection of MSECO 
- developers want to improve their technical knowledge in the ecosystem

### 4.B Feelings about work

- motivation is formed by complex socio-cognitive factors
- the importance of human factors in software development is well known
- there is little information on how affectiveness impacts software productivity and developer experience (fagerholm)
- affect-driven and judgement-driven behaviors

### 4.C The value of one's contribution 

- complex and difficult to predict

## 5. Final remarks and future work

- identified factors as self-marketing, emotional state and variety of work

## Personal thoughts about the text

- Why would a developer select which ecosystem to participate in? Isn't it only based on where the need of the app is, and in most cases it is the both platforms that need to be supported
- even in 4A, development infrastructure, there is stuff that is social, and not only about the technical part of the development infrastructure
