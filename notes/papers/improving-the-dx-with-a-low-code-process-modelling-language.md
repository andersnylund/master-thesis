# Improving the DX with a low-code process modelling language

## What is 1. Introduction

- OutSystems Platform is used to create applications with DSL
- The DSLs are visual modeling languages
- significantly faster development times, and higher quality result
- BPT business process technology
- BPT was not having expected adoption rate
- it's maintenance costs were too high
- they developed a new version of BTP with significantly better usability

## What is 5. Discussion

### What is 5.1 Evaluation of results

- **the perceived usability is better, and therefore the is potential to improve the developer experience**
- RQ1. symbols were not good in the original BPT
- RQ2. PoN = Physics of Notation
- RQ3. all alternatives to the original syntax were better
- RQ4. better understanding of the processes
- RQ5. ??
- RQ6. ??

### What is 5.2 Implications for practice

- The researchers did not use students, but professionals that had experience in other OutSystem platforms
- TLX score decreased and SUS score increased
- **Mean hit rate above the ISO treshold?**

### What is 5.3 Threats to validity

- All subjects were members of OutSystems
- 

## What is 7. Conclusions

- In the future, the process in this work can be expanded to include also textual languages, and not only visual modeling languages
- Requirements Engineering could be used to create techniques that help language engineers create constructs that answers the needs of the users, while having a high usability rating

## Personal thoughts about the text

- Relatively new article from 2018
- Is about a product that enables low-code implementation of products?
- They mention developer experience here and there, but never define what it is
