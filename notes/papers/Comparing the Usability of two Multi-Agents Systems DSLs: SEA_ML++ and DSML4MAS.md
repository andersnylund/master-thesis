# Comparing the Usability of two Multi-Agents Systems DSLs: SEA_ML++ and DSML4MAS

Conference Paper · October 2018

## Abstract

- comparison of two different DSLs for MAS with help of PoN
- focus on the extent to which the different language constructs impact on developer experience

## Introduction

- Software Languages Engineering (SLE) = making systematic process of developing a software language
- domain analysis and evaluation are not mature phases of the design of the language
- language usability
- "modellers" ≃ developers
- 

## Background

## Experiment planning

## Discussion

- 

## Summary

- goal to go beyond the concrete syntax, all the way to the abstract syntax of the modeling language

## Personal interpretations from the text

- Is PoN limited to DSLs?
  - yes, to visualization of software design and modeling
