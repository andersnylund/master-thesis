# How Do Software Developers Experience Team Performance in Lean and Agile Environments?

- RQ1: How do software practitioners experience team performance in Lean and Agile environments?
- RQ2: How do software practitioners reason about the relationships between perceived performance factors?

## What is Abstract

- Companies and organisations try to adapt to their business environment and team performance evaluation is difficult in these situations
- 33 major categories of performance factors
- Software teams are constantly trying to understand their performance
- To improve performance, it requires to integrate soft factors into the development process
- **What is Performance Experiences?**

## 1. What is Introduction

- Performance can be anything that has to do with the software, also the product's performance like technical quality or fitness for purpose
- When measuring teams the humans are brought up
- Software development is largely human-based activity -> outcome depend on human factors
- Motivation, skill, satisfaction, values, and personality are all important when creating high performing teams 
- But, it is still unknown how practitioners themselves experience the pursuit of being performant
- The study shows that it is not enough to define performance by measuring if the predefined objectives are achieved

## 2. What is Theoretical background

- 

## 3. What is Research approach

-

## 4. What is Results

- Performance Alignment Work is the core category

### 4.1 What is The meaning of performance

- **Performance awareness** is divided into 2 top-level categories "seeing the big picture" and "understanding job roles"
- **Interpreting performance** describes the desirable level of performance
  - This was a bit difficult to understand **come back to this later**

### 4.2 What is Factors Impacting Performance

- Multiple factors were beneficial for performance, and their absence was detrimental
- Both distributed work and re-organizations were reported as performance disruptors
- **What is meant by "Distributed work"?**
- An example of layoffs in a company shows that it took time to recover and evolve from those particular "dark times"
- Open office helps communication, but requires norms and signals to avoid the disruptions caused by it
- sometimes subjects felt it was better that someone outside the inexperienced team set the goals, and then sometimes more experienced felt that they themselves were the only ones capable of setting the goals
- Collaboration and competition between teams was mainly seen in the way that inter team collaboration was preferred. However, there were instances were inter team competition could increase motivation
- The role of the technical and automated tools are not that important in the performance of the team. **However, the "Tools" top-level category is 6th in the list**

### 4.3 What is Adapting Performance

- If there are external things that change, the subjects were ready to adapt and change
- Prioritization was seen as something that had been missing, but helped when they introduced e.g. a Kanban board
- Some subjects said that *"Lean and Agile values and the spirit of a continuous search for better "*
- One subject said that adapting and changing should not be done just for the case of changing
- Learning from failures is important and convincing other teams to adapt the solution to the failure is crucial

### 4.4 What is The High-Performing Software Team

- The subject themselves explained what a high-performing team is
- Good teams often have a do-it spirit
- *"Some people do not fit into the Scrum team and its way of working"*
- Team Identity is important, and therefore the existing team members should be involved in the selection process of new team members 
- The motivation of individuals to develop themselves is really important to the performance of the whole team
- New team members with high motivation are welcome
- Inclusion and exclusion are discussed topics in the paper
- High performing teams can create a team-spirit where individuals get a feeling of belonging
- Pride
- Material rewards do not work, but however social experiences that support the team-building can work
- 

## 5. What is Discussion and limitations

- Based on the study, performance is seen by practitioners as a continuous process of negotiation within the team and the stakeholders

### 5.1 What is Addressing the Research Questions

- Performance Alignment Work is the type of teamwork where the team addresses the performance goals of their work, and the work where they try to achieve these goals
- The subjects in the study reasoned about performance from individual level, all the way to organizational marketplace performance
- Practitioners have their own understanding and beliefs on how their work affects the team and organization
  - Activities that makes awareness of these beliefs could help the teams to become more performant
- A high-performing team is a team that is exceptionally good at Performance Alignment Work
- *"high-performing teams are considered high-performing because they influence the criteria by which they are judged"*
- *"there are important affective aspects, and conative aspects beyond motivation, that should be considered in research on team performance"*
- There are some weak indications that there were company culture differences in the studied subject's companies
- Other research has not concluded how motivation of developers works, and what the benefits of motivated developers are
- *"Aligning affective and conative aspects within the team could be another means to reach better performance"*
  - It is probably easier to construct the team based on the values, than to change the team-members based on that

## 5.2. What is Threats to Validity

- The researchers setup
- Coaches and team leads were interviewed, because they have the most experience of the company, the teams, the organization, experienced both high and low performance
- Subjects were all finnish companies and therefore the subjects have special characteristics

## 6. What is Conclusions

- Team performance can not be measured through some predefined objectives
  - Because these are changing constantly and are subjectively interpreted
- Performance exists on multiple different levels: individual, teams, organisations, markets, and customers
- Understanding the experience of performance helps to improve the working conditions and actual performance
- Future research
  - Hypothesis: experience of performance arises from basic social psychology
  - how do practitioners alter their behaviour as a result of interpreting the principles of Lean and Agile software development?
  - What aspects of good performance do developers and customers agree or disagree on? E.g. how do different stakeholder and their interpretation of performance differ from each other

## Interpretations from the text

- The role of tools in performance was not addressed that much
  - However, in the beginning of the article there was a statement that performance depends highly on the social factors

## Personal thoughts about the text

- Quite difficult to read
- Addresses complex subjects
- In the end the master thesis' research problem, as it is now, will measure the performance of the software teams, and therefore this and the following paper will be probably really interesting
- I see that the article is talking about the same problem that I had in mind when starting to form my research problem and questions. Therefore I also see that the problem and questions needs a tremendous amount of improvement
- The initial problem was about the success of software projects
  - The article talks about the close connection in practitioners' experience between performance and success
- More and more I think that the master thesis should be studying about some tool or framework that helps in the daily work of developers
- The interviews done in this master thesis could be aimed towards a special kind of practitioners in the organization, e.g. developers and/or team-leads
- This article seemed to be more interesting than what I thought in the beginning
- The list(s) of categories in this article is a very good list of possible subjects to study further on
  - It shows that there are so many different aspects to what could be included in the definition of Developer Experience
- The performance is not dependent on the technical factors, but on the social factors
- It feels like when there are examples and citations from the interviews, it helps me to understand the topics tremendously better
