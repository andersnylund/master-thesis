## Abstract

- testing makes up to 50% of the development cost
- much effort has been put to minimize the required human activities in testing
- however, testing is still a human based activity
- a better understanding of testers' feelings, perceptions, and motivations
- the better the TX the better the result
- TX captures how testers think and feel about their activities withing the software testing environment

## I. Introduction

- Human factors the most important in software development
- DX is a means of capturing how developers think and feel about their activities within their software development environments
- testers must be involved in the development process from the very early stages to identify the required qualities
- finding and fixing a bug after delivery is 100x more expensive than finding and fixing it during requirements and design phase
- several factors have acted as barriers for proper inclusion of tests
  - lack of expertise
  - lack of support tools
  - high cost
  - difficult to use
  - time-consuming
  - lack of knowledge about testing
- definition TX helps to understand, analyze, design and improve project environments with respect to testers' perceptions and feelings
- three main categories of factors affecting TX (cognition, conation and affection)

## II. “Experiences”in Software Engineering

- Developer Experience
  - relating to all artifacts and activities that a developer may encounter as part of his/her involvement in software development

## III. Related Works on Tester Experience

## IV. Defining Tester Experience

## V. Conclusion and Future Works

- TX is based on literature reviews and transferring ideas from UX and DX
