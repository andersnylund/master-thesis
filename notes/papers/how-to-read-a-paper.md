## The three-pass approach

### First pass

- five to ten minutes
- 5 C's
  - Category
  - Context
  - Correctness
  - Contributions
  - Clarity
- Many readers will only pass it once and therefore you should focus in your own papers to write a concise and clear abstract, introduction, and conclusion

### Second pass

- Look at the overall quality of the paper from e.g. diagrams 
- Mark relevant unread references

### Thirds pass

- Virtually re-implement the paper
- Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement

## Doing a literature survey

- Go trough the authors websites and find the top conferences

## Experience

- Prevents from falling into too much detail in the beginning
- Helps to evaluate how long it takes to review a set of papers
- Adjust the depth of the reviews
