# Facing up the primary emotions in Mobile Software Ecosystems from Developer Experience

## Abstract 

- to understand the emotions in DX, QA sites were mined
- comparing Android, iOS, and Windows
- sadness, anger, and joy

## 1. Introduction

- interactions between developers and the different platforms are influenced by emotions
- *"Developer eXperience (DX) is defined as the experiences related to the developerâ€™s interactions during software development"*
- there has been done information mining on software repositories to extract information about socio-technical perspectives
- keystones are interested in this, as they can anticipate threats in their communities

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Mobile Software Ecosystem and Developer eXperience

- *"The experiences related to all kinds of artifacts and activities that a developer may encounter as part of their interaction in mobile application development has been explored as Developer Experience (DX)."*

### 2.2 Mining Q&A repositories and Emotions

- Both technical and social information can be mined from software repositories
- Stack Overflow is used as the software repository

## 5. Result analysis

- Developers use Q&A when facing a difficulty
- A big part (about half) of the questions relate to sadness

## 6. Threats to validity

- 

## 7. Conclusions

- Sadness: use of emulators and devices, and manipulation of UI elements
- Anger: unavailability or incompatibility of resources when using libraries or customizing methods
- Joy: better and simple practices
- These all emotions can be addressed when considering the DX of the platforms

## Personal thoughts about the text

- Quite straightforward
- Reports only the bare results, and does not try to analyze and make any specific conclusions from the information and data
