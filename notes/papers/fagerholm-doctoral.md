# Fagerholm doctoral thesis

## What is abstract

- Human factors impact the performance and quality of software development the most
- *"Success of a software projects can not only include fulfillment of schedules and profitability, but also employee well-being" and public impact*
- Explains what software developer experience, how experience arises, how experience leads to changes in software artifacts and development environment 
- Lean-Agile software development has the developers to engage in Performance Alignment Work
  - PAW is where the developer themselves understand what performance is on all levels, and when they try to themselves improve it
- Lean and Agile development puts a lot of the responsibility to the developers themselves. Therefore they also need to understand the value system of their work so that they can do the right everyday decisions.  

## 1. What is Introduction

- A framework to structure how development outcomes and the subjective experience can be explained in human factors
  - This has been missing in research altogether
- Understanding what developer experience is and how it relates to the software project results can help in finding and adapting new processes. Because when understanding how the developer experience might change, there is one additional aspect that can be taken into consideration when measuring if new changes are worth it or not
- Personal relevance of developers is something that can be enabled when understanding the developer experience
  
### 1.1 What is motivation

- Traditionally problems in software engineering has been solved with help of engineering paradigms
- Software development is not the same thing as manufacturing. It requires to understand the complex nature of social interactions e.g. to understand what the customer requires and needs at a specific point in time
- Software is becoming more and more important in everyday life, and the estimates show that a big part of companies and workers will be in contact with software development. There are even estimates that every company will become software companies at some point in the future.
- Human factors is in a key role in improving performance, but probably more importantly, also well-being.
- Lean-Agile software development emphasizes people, collaboration, customer involvement, and flexible adaption (Dingsøyr et al. 2012)
- Before there was no framework to measure the experiences that developers have in software development projects

### 1.2 What is Research Questions and Scope

## 4 Software Developer Experience

- it must be understood that DX and UX are not the same

### 4.1 Concept and definition

- "developer experience is situated in the mind of individual developers"
- "processing social information is part of software development work"
- "Artefacts and activities are represented in the mind, and experience arises when the mind interacts with the internal representations as well as with hte external environment"

### 4.2 

### 4.5 What is Summary

- The models derived are not definitive, not too abstract and neither case specific. Therefore they can be a good ground to build up the understanding of what Developer Experience could be in different software projects.
- Figure 4.1 shows the developer experience as 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional. The 2 dimensions are the social and the technical environment. The 3 dimensions are cognition, affect, and conation. 
- Figure 4.4 and Table 4.4 can be used to study Developer Experience
- Developer Experience can be a short term or instant experience, but also a long-term or repeated experience.
  - Based on the research it can be decided which of them should be focused on
- 7 Different aspect of developer experience
  - Experience object
  - Experience formation
  - Experience influencers
  - Experience content
  - Experience progression
  - Behavior outcome
  - Object outcome
- The Developer Experience might change the behavior of the developer, that then again changes the teams' or some other context's developer experience
- *"In Article II, The experience object – what is experienced – is team performance in Lean-Agile environments. This is an example of a broad, holistic setting."*
- A narrow specific setting could be examining how developers use IDEs.
  - The framework helps to differentiate between an user experience and a developer experience study.
  - Without using the framework presented, a study of usage of an IDE would probably only focus on the usability and cognitive parts of the IDE, while the developer experience study would also consider more than that (incl. affective and conative)

## 5. What is Discussion

### 5.1 What is Theoretical Implications

## 5. What is Conclusions

- Performance Alignment Work

## Interpretations from the text
- 

## Personal thoughts about the text

- The thesis jumps from examining DEX to virtual teams in open source projects???
  - Do these have anything in common to make the thesis coherent?
- **Take a look on and understand the Figure 4.4 and Table 4.4**
- The Master Thesis based on this PhD doesn't need to, and shouldn't be as advanced
  - However, it is a must to understand what the PhD dissertation is telling and what the results are of it
- The research of the Master Thesis is probably going to be done in a context of Lean-Agile software development
- **What is the theoretical framework for understanding developer experience?**
- Create some more specific hypotheses to test in the Master Thesis
- Fabian told that he noticed during and after his thesis, that the definition of Developer Experience still needs some better definitions
