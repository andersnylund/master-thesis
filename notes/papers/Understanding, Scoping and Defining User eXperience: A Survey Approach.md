# Understanding, Scoping and Defining User eXperience: A Survey Approach

https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518813

# Abstract

- it has been hard to gain a common agreement on the nature and scope of UX
- UX is dynamic, context-dependent, and subjective
- UX is something individual (instead of social)
- the survey result is in line with the ISO definition

## Introduction

- there has been a quick adoption of the notion of UX without being clearly defined or understood
- the traditional techniques of the usability framework in HCI is not enough and has its limitations
- UX shifts the focus towards non-utilitarian aspects to affects and sensations
- there's been workshops on UX but they have resulted in a number of diverse (quasi-) definitions and viewpoints on UX 
- difficult to get an universal definition of UX
  1. fuzzy and dynamic concepts, including emotional, affective, experiential, hedonic, and aesthetic variables
  2. single aspect of one user to all aspects of different user groups
  3. fragmented and complicated by diverse theoretical models
- uses of a UX definition
  1. facilitate scientific discourse => avoid communication breakdowns
  2. manage practical applications of UX
  3. will help teaching of the notion of UX
- during the study the ISO 9241 standards were revised

## The survey

### Rationale for Conducting a survey

- the expectation was that opinions and views on UX would diverge, as the term has been used both with and without definition
- the assumption was that a web based survey created based on literature and practical knowledge of veteran UX researchers and researchers, to gather the required information 

### Organization of the Questionnaire

- Three sections with a set of questions
  - UX statements, UX definitions, Your background
- statements about 5 point scale of disagree-agree
- express opinions on definitions, how they liked and disliked them
- background about work and education, why interested in UX, and how central UX is 

### Survey Administration and Response

- wide spread of where the survey was advertised

## Results and discussions

### Respondent's background 

- majority of respondents from industry
- researchers educated in HCI working in industry want to design better products and find UX very central to their work 

### Statements of UX

- UX is dynamic, context-dependent, and subjective however not futile
- something new that is part of HCI domain and grounded in UCD practices

### Agreement Levels and Background

- difference in the background didn't affect the results
- there is a difference between the scandinavian and north american approach to UX 

### Definitions of UX

- primary role and country of residence play somewhat role in the selection of the definition

### Reasons for Picking Definitions

- there was some specific things that showed up when respondents gave feedback about the definitions
  - temporal: the definitions did not emphasize enough the time aspect of UX
  - framework: UX should be understood through the conceptual lens of a CoP 
  - elements: ingredients of an UX, measurable aspects
  - scoping: 
- the notion of UX is understood very differently
- biggest difference between respondents is between USA and Europe
  - might be caused by some philosophical assumption about experience

## Reflection

### Social or individual

- community may share the experience
- "a group can experience together, but the experience we are investigating is still inside each individual of that group"

### User Experience in Relation to Other Experiences

- "What is the relation between brand experience and user experience? How about user experience and product or service experience? Or just plain experience?"
- brand experience
  - you forgive flaws for a loved brand
  - once interaction happens, user experience happens and that affects brand experience
- product experience
  - narrower scope than UX
- service experience
  - face-to-face services are not UX as humans do not have a user interface, humans can not be used
  - product user experience is separate from the user experience of the product-related service

### Experience Before, During, and After Interaction

- industry is more interested in long-term user experience

### ISO Definition of UX

- ISO definition was still in draft stage when this paper was written

## Conclusion

- there is not that big difference in the respondents perceptions
- ISO standard seems promising

## Personal interpretations from the text

- the ISO definition of UX has been proposed, but gotten some critique of not taking everything into account?
- use this paper to create the interview questions for this study as the aim of the study is basically exactly the same
- there are not definitions of DX like there is of UX, what I know about at this time
  - e.g. how the 5 different definitions in this article are short paragraphs that try to include every aspect of UX
- include the definition of the different experiences into the thesis?
