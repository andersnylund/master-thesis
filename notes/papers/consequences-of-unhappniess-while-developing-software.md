## Abstract

- comprehension of consequences of unhappiness among developers is still too shallow

## 1. Introduction

- software developer happiness is correlated to performance, productivity, and quality

- low motivation
- work withdrawal
- low productivity

### 4.C External consequences - Process

- delay
- deviate from the process
- broken flow

### 4.D External consequences - Artifact-oriented

- low code quality
- discharging code

## 5. Discussion

### 5.B Recommendation for Practitioners

-  previous research [4] has suggested that intervening on the affect of developers might have relatively low costs and astonishing benefits.

## 6. Conclusion

- the present study enforces the stance that many aspects of software engineering research require approaches from the behavioral and social sciences
