## What is Abstract

- Software development is teamwork and they need tools that help them to collaborate
- Experienced coders saw no benefits of a collaborative online coding environment
- In general developers reported pragmatic benefits and increased motivation

## 1. What is Introduction

- Software development work is global and requires collaboration as e.g. pair programming
- Working and collaborating together has benefits
- Even if UX is defined in ISO standard, and captures everything in DX, it is not however comprehensive enough to capture all the nuances of DX
- Fagerholm and Münch have the first definition of DX
- Coding camp where student solved a problem using an IDE

### 1.1 What is The IDE Features

- Simultaneous coding
- Drag n drop UI editor
- Comments of the code
- First iteration of the IDE didn't support micro-commits

## 2. What is Related Work

- **Why is not the ISO standard's generic definition enough to understand details of developer's experience in collaborative coding?**
- Somewhere is a statement that developers need to occasionally work independently uninterrupted

### 2.1 What is Sociability and Social Support

- *"Being sociable at work in software development context has both positive and negative impacts"*
- Interruptions in the same context are not that harsh

### 2.2 What is Collaboration and Communication

- Cooperative work consists of
  1. positive interdependence
  2. individual accountability
  3. promotive interaction
  4. social skills
  5. group processing
- Lightweight interaction can be chatting loosely about the work related stuff. This helps teammates to understand their each other's tasks

### 2.3 What is Activity Theory Covering DEX Factors

- Activity Theory explains how collaboration works in e.g. software development
- activity theory model is built around objects, subjects, and artifacts
- activity theory is very complex and involves multiple aspects
- hierarchy of activities
  - activity level - motive: developing a functioning web service during the code camp
  - action level - goal: integrate fb login
  - operation - conditions: select language construct
- *"in the very early stage when learning to type they need to search for each required key on their keyboard, and later they will be able write lines of code without consciously thinking about it."*

## 3. What is User study on experience in collaborative coding

- groups of three to four
- origin of country and genders mixed
  
### 3.1 Methods and Results of Data Collection

- semi-structured interviews with a set of participants
- UX curve drawn by the participants

### 3.2 Data Analysis

- quantitative and qualitative understanding of the hedonic and pragmatic qualities of the IDE
- categorization created larger themes from the data

## 4. What is Results

- summarize data obtained and present a framework for collaborative programming environments 

### 4.1 Pragmatic and Hedonic Quality of the IDE

- Attrakdiff divides the quality of a product into pragmatic and hedonic qualities
- **DEX, or the UX of the developer**
- *pragmatic quality* - (PQ) - indicating how efficiently and effectively users can achieve their goals using the product
- *hedonic quality* – stimulation (HQ-S) describing how well the product supports personal growth – novelty, stimulation and challenge)
- *hedonic quality* – identity (HQ-I) expressing to what extent the user can identify with the product
- *attractiveness* - (ATT) describing user’s overall quality perception about the product
- participants rated the system slightly positively
- the participants had previous experience from other IDEs, and therefore this IDE was rated more "cheap"

### 4.2 Distracting and positive new experiences

- experienced developers thoughts that there were missing features
- some developers wouldn't probably have liked the environment, even if all the problems and missing features were fixed
- the most benefit from the IDE came when the students were working from home on their spare time
- there was two different views in the IDE, and many participants used a view where they weren't distracted by other collaborators

### 4.3 Developer experience of the collaborative

- candidates that influenced the DEX of the participants
  - agreed policies e.g. coding styles and collaboration rules
  - being polite
  - roles e.g. UI or server side
  - situational, pair programming and individual work
  - dynamic shifting of working in pairs and groups to solve difficult problems
  - differences in committing the code the "traditional" way and the "collaborative" style
- group shuffling

### 4.4 Framework for collaborative developer experience

- when reflecting the IDE, the developers were talking about their team members
- *"This example illustrates how DEX is more than just the experience of using a tool. The tools, processes and other people dynamically form the experience"*
- majority of the support by the IDE is cognitive, but there is also rules, community and division of labour
- a like button (was implemented) and gave support to the developers when they could approve other's code (hedonism, nurturing). Good conventions can be found this way (pragmatic benefit)
- affect and conation should be the design targets in designing similar systems
-  

## 5. What is Discussion

- Developers were not complaining that much about distractions as the authors thought would happen
  - 3 reasons:
    1. Interruptions happened in the same context (they were coding some app, and someone came and asked a question about coding the same app?) 
    2. participants were students that were prepared for this and had no financial pressure
    3. easier to empathize with people interrupting
- Participants were not using the IDE completely remotely and were working face to face
- Activities like TODOs and other lists of tasks were not considered in the application
- Study used with students. Experienced developers would probably not have liked it at all
  - **What are the contradictions of the profession that experienced developers would have had?**
- *"The development refers also to the fact, that the actors raise the abstraction level of their automated operations: in the very early stage when learning to type they need to search for each required key on their keyboard, and later they will be able write lines of code without consciously thinking about it."*

## 6. What is Conclusion

- They created a framework for designing collaborative coding environments
- Findings that help to understand DEX in collaborative coding

## Interpretations from the text

- 

## Personal thoughts about the text

- This paper is also from 2015, so it is relatively "old"
- Here the question about collaboration arises again, and that working together supports work satisfaction, higher productivity and innovation
- This kind of research of a tool would be very interesting for me. **But why is this specifically interesting?**
  - I like to have a quick setup where there is no overhead of setting up files
- Studying collaborative coding might not be a good choice for this study, as probably little or no one in day to day consultancy work are actually working in pairs
  - Here the problem of working alone without collaboration, on your own specific thing comes up
  - Is it because of working together with people, that I like to become more of a generalist?
- **Could the table in this paper be used for some other kind of study?** 
- Activity theory could be used in the thesis to explain how development teams work

From software developer as users:
*"Palviainen et al. [18] construe the concept of developer experience via activity theory and thus divide it into categories related to tool, object, actor, rules, community, and division of labor. Moreover, they [18] discuss the support of development environment to developer experience with regard to operation, action and activity-level support."*
