## Abstract

- traditionally releasing software was problematic
- the goal is to be able to always deploy the system
- requires a high degree of automation
- new mindset required
- in this paper we study the developer perspective of applying continuous delivery
- we place the focus on how continuous delivery practices affect software developers and what are the prerequisites for achieving continuous delivery
- higher quality and other benefits of continuous delivery can be achieved by giving developers more responsibility
- the added responsibilities do not necessarily increase stress, but can actually decrease it
- the added responsibility can also improve motivation and job satisfaction

## 1 Introduction

- traditionally deployments to production have been rare
- solving unpredictable problems
- packaging, testing and deploying the software has to bee automated
- the issues of CD are driving the DevOps phenomenon, a new way of organizing responsibilities at work
- study based on a series of interviews of practicing software developers
  - these developers have worked in a traditional way but now changed to use CD

## 2 Background and related work

- 4 criteria for CD
  1. software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
  2. team places a higher priority on keeping the software deployable than on working with new features 
  3. automated, rapid cycle produces feedback regarding production readiness after any changes to the software
  4. any developer can perform a push-button deployment of any version of the software to any environment
- automation plays a key role, and requires infrastructure-as-code
- CD requires close collaboration between everyone
  - therefore motivation is important
- motivation among developers is different to other occupational groups (Motivation in software engineering: A
systematic literature review)
- DX aims to provide an intuitive abstraction of the huge variety and quantity of human factors that influence software developers and the outcomes of software engineering
- UX considers the context of users
- DX considers the context of development and developers
- In general DX includes aspects beyond software development tools, such as development processes, modelling methods, and other means of structuring software engineering tasks 
- DX culminates in results from (Peopleware: productive projects and teams)
  - SE involves issues related to humans, cooperation, and teamwork
- important to have mechanisms for team formation and for teams to empower and self-direct themselves (Olsson et al, “Climbing the ”stairway to heaven” - a multiple-case study exploring barriers in the transition from agile development towards continuous deployment of software.)
- there are also reports of developers adopting CD (Continuous Delivery? Easy! Just Change Everything (Well,  Maybe It Is Not That Easy).)

## 4 Results 

### 4.1 It's all about automation

### 4.2 Readiness to Production Deployment

### 4.3 Impact on Commitment

## 5 Discussion

## 6 Conclusions

- CD has other benefits than just fast feedback
- CD changes how devs do their tasks and how they feel about the project and the organization
- interviews on lead developers
- more unified team with CD
- more motivated and committed people
- practices that improve quality and readiness to act on problem lessens stress
- the longer the time since the last deployment, the less confident developers are that it's going to work
- teem feels positive and empowered despite the responsibilities and demands

## Personal interpretations

- peopleware might not be a good name at all
