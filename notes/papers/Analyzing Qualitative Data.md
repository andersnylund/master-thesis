## Introduction

- words and observations
- requires creativity, discipline and a systematic approach
- content analysis

## Narrative data

- response to open-ended questions on a survey
- transcripts
- notes from a log or diary, field notes, or the text of a published reports
- discussion group or focus group interviews often involve full transcripts and notes from a moderator or observer
- observations in field notes or descriptive accounts as a result of watching and listening
- stories from personal accounts or result of programs in people's own words
- case studies

## The analysis process

- process is fluid

### Step 1 Get to know your data. 

- write down impressions as you are reading or listening to the data
- there is also bad data that does not provide any value 
- explain the limitations and level of analysis

### Step 2 Focus the analysis. 

- identify key questions that you want you analysis to answer
- start with the questions, but allow them to change when the understanding of the problem changes
- *focus by question or topic, time period, or event*
  - organize the data by question to look for consistencies or differences
  - explore the connections and relationships between questions
- *focus by case, individual, or group*
  - analyse case by case as a whole

### Step 3 Categorize information

- "coding the data" or "indexing the data"
- categorizing is not assigning numerical values as in quantitative analysis
- **the crux of qualitative analysis**
  - identify themes or patterns
  - organize the into coherent categories
- two ways to categorize
  1. preset categories
    - identified themes based on literature or previous knowledge
  2. emergent categories
    - ideas and concept that you had not thought about
  - combining both strategies works also
  - subcategories

### Step 4 Identify patterns and connections within and between categories. 

- patterns and connections
- *within category description*
  - write a summary for each category that describes the key ideas, similarities and differences, subtle variations
- *larger categories*
  - super categories that combine several categories
- *relative importance*
  - count the number of times a particular theme comes up, or unique respondents
  - this is not statistical data, but can reveal general patterns in the data
- *relationships*
  - some themes are always mentioned together (youth with divorced parents list friendship important)
  - cause effect relationship? be cautious with these 
  - develop a matrix or table to illustrate relationships across two or more categories
  - looking at items that do not fit anywhere can teach a lot of new and important things

### Step 5 Interpretation – Bringing it all together 

- use the themes and connections to explain your findings
- what does it all mean? what is really important?
- attaching meaning and significance to the analysis
- stand back and think about the big picture of the stuff you've done and what you have learned
  - what would others benefit to know about this study?
- it is often helpful to illustrate your points and bring the data to life
  - this can also help to reveal gaps in the model or data
  - can give suggestions on further studies

## “Nuts and bolts” of narrative analysis

- the detailed part of how to perform analysis on e.g. interview data

## Enhancing the process

- bias is a problem
- *use several sources of data*
  - triangulation of different research methods
- *track you choices*
  - keep a journal or notebook on the decisions during the analysis process
  - this helps replication of the study and analysis, but also gives others a good understanding of why things and result are as they are
- *involve others*
  - having multiple researchers doing the categorization will help to create a common understanding because everyone have their own view on the problem and topic in question

## Pitfalls to avoid

- *avoid generalizing*
  - qualitative approach seeks to provide understanding from the respondent's perspective
  - "what is unique about this individual, group, situation or issue, WHY?"
- *choose quotes carefully*
  - problem of being out of context
  - specify why you selected the quotes that you select, so that the reader understands if you want to highlight difference or similarity between respondents
- *address limitations and alternatives*
  - present the problems you had while doing the work helps other to understand the context better
