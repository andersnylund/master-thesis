# Programmer eXperience: A Systematic Literature Review

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920124

## What is Abstract

- PX, UX and usability of programming environments, design documents, and programming codes is considered
- Results are that
  - 1) motivation and the choice of tools are the most important things that affect the PX
  - 2) aim to understand the influence of PX on programming environments
  - 3) usability tests or heuristic evaluation used in the research
  - 4) four sets of heuristics **what are these heuristics?**
  - there is a need of more research in the area of PX (DX)
  
## I. What is introduction

- Programming codes = codes in maintenance
- Heuristic evaluation = evaluation based on some broad guidelines, rather than specific tests (e.g. user surveys)
- Studied papers published over the last 10 years to understand what Programmer Experience means
- This study revealed that there was several articles with sets of heuristics to understand and evaluate these software artifacts

## II. What is background

### A. What is user experience

- Multiple different definitions
  - "person's perceptions and responses resulting from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system, or service"
  - "UX considers the way people use an interactive product, and their perceptions of use and the feelings involved during the interaction"
  - usable, useful, desirable, findable, accessible, valuable, and credible

### B. What is usability

### C. Heuristic evaluation

### D. Programmer Experience

## III. What is Research method

### A. What is Research questions

### B. What is Data source

### C. What is search strategy

### D. What is Selection criteria

### E. What is data extraction

### F. What is data synthesis

## IV. What is Results

### A. What is Study Selection

### B. What is Data source

### C. What is What is the programmer experience

### D. What is What types of studies were published about programmer experience, user experience or usability regarding the programming environment, design documents and programming codes

### E. What evaluation methods are used in those studies

### F. What types of sets of usability heuristics are used when evaluating programming environments and software development artifacts

## V. What is discussion 

- Technical and social skills, and intrinsic motivation compose the PX
- Current research is majorly focused on usability of programming environments
- **Heuristic evaluations?** 
  - Informal way of evaluating the usability of a system
- Four sets of heuristics
  1. One for Programming environments and languages
  2. One for Languages
  3. Two for APIs
  - **How are these related to the heuristics developed by Nielsen?**
- PX is more specific than DX
  - DX includes also the motivation 
- *"Programming environments are the artifacts most used by programmers"*
- Usability is important in the programming environment
- **What the hell is a SET OF HEURISTICS**
  - Wikipedia: "Examples that employ heuristics include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, a guesstimate, profiling, or common sense"

## VI. What is Conclusion

- What does it mean that the researchers didn't find heuristics to evaluate design documents
- 

## Interpretation from the text

- What is the assumption before reading the paper?
  - Developer Experience is divided into cognitive, affective, and conative aspects 
- What are we debating in our thesis?
- What is the argument from this article to the debate?
- This paper has on purpose focused on PX, as in considers more technical aspects
- **What is the difference between a programmer and developer**
  - In the article the programmer is focused more on the technical parts of creating software. A developer can be thought of as a more "wider" role where the task is not only to program (write the code), but also take care of planning, requirements, design, implementation, testing, communication etc.
- Heuristics is used because of its speed, low cost, and effectiveness.
- Heuristic evaluation is less used than tests with users 

## Personal thoughts about the text

- The paper has an focus on the cognitive aspects of Developer Experience
- There is still some air around the terms developer experience and programmer experience, and it is based on the literature very difficult to summarize what they actually are
- Why is there results already in the introduction?
