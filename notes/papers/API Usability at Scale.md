# API Usability at Scale

## Abstract

- design and maintenance of APIs is challenging
- six on-going challenges: 
  1. resource allocation
  2. empirically-grounded guidelines
  3. communicating issues
  4. supporting API evolution over time
  5. usable auth
  6. usable client libraries at scale

## Introduction

- APIs allow accessing functionality created by others
- web APIs are the major way of connecting services today
- there is little work on API usability, when considering their importance
- this is an experience report

## Challenge 1: UX Resource Allocation

- There is a high requirement for experts to improve the usability of APIs
- however, UX experts are expensive and they should be used wherever they are needed the most

## 2. Challenge 2: Empirically-Grounded Guidelines

- the API can be improved with help of usability metrics

## 3. Challenge 3: Communicating Issues

- there is a lot of data on how the APIs are used and misused
- 

## 4. Challenge 4: Supporting Change

## 5. Challenge 5: Usable Auth

- improved security requires more complex auth systems and logic
- this has however affected the developer experience of using the API
- previous improvements of API auth usability has tackled only a subset of the design space
  - local optimization leads to more variations of credentials, documentation, restrictions, and failure paths

## 6. Challenge 6: Usable Client Libraries at Scale

- developers write idiomatic, even idiosyncratic code
- auto-generated vs hand-written client libraries
- googles hand written library resulted in more successful completion of the development task, less erroneous assumptions about the surface of the API, required fewer resources to complete the task
- developer experience here is the usability of the API

## Personal interpretations from the text

- they just mention developer experience, but never quite tell what it is
