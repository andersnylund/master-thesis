## Abstract

- testing randomized algorithms has been a challenge
- ReTest
- single-subject experiment assesses the feasibility fo ReTest
- study on DX when using ReTest

## 1 Introduction

- deterministic algorithm produces expected results
- randomized algorithms produce different correct outputs
  - these algorithms depend on various random decisions made during their execution
  - use pseudo-random numbers
- as with any other code there will be faults if they are not tested
- however, it is usually possible to check if the generated output is valid or not
- traditional TDD principles doesn't work with non-deterministic algorithms
- a single-subject experiment carried out to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach in an algorithm implementation involving multiple random decisions in sequence
- a study to assess the developer’s experience when using ReTest framework that automates the approach steps.

## 2 Background

## 3 Research method

- evaluation of ReTest in terms of
  - ease of use
  - usefulness
  - perceived benefits
  - drawbacks
  - difficulties
- questionnaire with open and closed questions
- studying DX can give valuable input for analyzing and adjusting new development techniques, procedures, and tools

## 4 Approach to automate tests randomized logic

## 5 Feasibility study: a single-subject experiment

## 6 ReTest: test framework for randomized algorithms

## 7 ReTest framework: a developer experience assessment

- not possible to perform a comparative study between "using and not using" a tool

### 7.1 Goals

- assess aspect of this approach
  - **what is this approach?**
- National Institute of Space Research (INPE)
- are less experienced developers able to apply the proposed approach with help of ReTest framework
- main difficulties?
- benefits and drawbacks?
- usefulness? 

### 7.2 Participants

- division into 2 different groups
- remarkably experienced participants

### 7.3 Instrumentation and procedures

- comprehensive guidelines were given to the participants on how to conduct the task and on how to report the experiences

### 7.4 Implementation task

- specific requirements and guidelines on how to implement the algorithm was given to the participants

### 7.5 Results

#### 7.5.1 Experience

- less experienced were able to perform the task

#### 7.5.2 Difficulties encountered

- no bigger difficulties encountered

#### 7.5.3 Benefits and drawbacks

#### 7.5.4 Perceived usefulness

- 90% stated that the framework helped a lot

## 8 Discussion and limitations

- 

## 9 Conclusion

- first study
  - suggests that it is possible to find more bugs with the proposed approach
  - design of randomized algorithms can be improved
  - maintainability of the algorithm
- second
  - ReTest easy to use
  - despite the difficulties, everyone were able to complete the task
- no statements because limitations and threats to validity
