# Flow, Intrinsic Motivation, and Developer Experience in Software Engineering

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-33515-5_9

## What is Abstract

- *"Software developers are both users of development tools but also designers of new software systems"*
- Intrinsic motivation and autotelic experience are significant predictor of developers' UX

## 1. What is Introduction

- Developers are required to both know technical skills to implement the software, but also social skills to communicate with the software development team
- Little has been studied and therefore little is known how developers e.g. interact with IDEs and their experience with it
- There has been several studies [2-5] that happier developers produce better results
- Developers are in an interesting role as they are both the creators of new systems, but also users of existing software products and services
- The aim with the study is to understand what makes up the DX of an IDE measured in state of flow, intrinsic motivation and user experience
- IDE selection is often done by the employer
- Contribution is understanding developers as users

## 2. What is Background

### What is Motivation and flow

- IM is about when someone engages in tasks because it is pleasurable and enjoyable
- EM is about doing tasks because of its outcomes
- Flow is a state of concentration that enables absolute absorption of an activity
- Flow state requires
  1. clear set of goals and progress
  2. feedback
  3. balance between challenge and skills 

### What is User Experience

- subjective, context-dependent, and dynamic
- user's expectation, needs and motivation
- hedonic-pragmatic

### What is Software Engineering

- Developer's social skills have been discussed to be more important than their technical skills
- IDEs function as a interface between the developer and the computing infrastructure
- IDEs increase developer speed and reduce errors
- **DX: cognitive, motivational, affective and social aspects**
- *Cognitive factors also concern larger structures in software development, such as methods and processes, but research on this aspect is scarce.*

### What is Developer Experience and Motivation

- DX considers software development beyond the context of tools, including processes, modeling tools
- developers use software to further build software
- there is a lack of detail on what the actual things in th "work in itself" are motivating to developers 
- mood and happiness have been showed to affect the productivity of developers 

## 3. What is Method

## 4. What is Results

- **Perceived choice of use?**
  - Does perceived choice mean that the developer thinks that the choice has already been done, and that they can not affect the choice anymore?
  - Motivation of developers is affected by the selected tools and the quality of the selected tools
- The IDEs qualities and opportunities for improvement

## 5. What is Discussion

- **Autotelic experience?**
  - If the developers find that using the IDE has a purpose, or they have strong intrinsic motivation, it can predict the UX of the developers using the IDE 
- One quality attribute (practical, hedonic, general quality) by itself can not predict need fulfillment
  - Together they however are a predictor of need fulfillment
- Perceived choice has a negative correlation with the frequency of feeling frustrated. => If the developers themselves have the right to select their tools, the will probably also be more happy with their choice 

### What is Reflections on Concept of Developer Experience

- **Our results indicate that developers also address the infrastructure via intention and affect.**
- Some developers explained the best things about the IDE with affection, and not pragmatic 
- *our results suggest that Fagerholm et al. over emphasized the cognitive approach of developers towards the development infrastructure.*
  - Fagerholm et al is here the article "Developer Experience: Concept and Definition"
- This study can not separate motivation towards development work itself and motivation towards the software under development 
  
### What is Threats to Validity

- 

## 6. What is Conclusions

- How flow, IM, and UX are intertwined in software development
- IM and sense of flow are significant predictors of DX
- This work looked at DX in relation to the IDE, a key development tools

## Interpretations from the text

- Is there a hidden linkage between happier developers and better results e.g. that happier developers have a better DX and therefore also produce better results

## Personal opinions about the text

- In my small bubble it is very rarely seen that someone has to use a specific IDE in their work
  - I'd say that part of this study is meaningless
- All in all the less perceived choice, the less enjoyment
- **Predicted DX**, what does this mean?
