## Abstract

- the guidelines presented here were successfully applied to a SLR
- snowballing might be a better approach than database searches 

## 1. Introduction

- evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) (Kitchenham)
- there is a need for a systematic approach for collecting, combining, and analysin previous research
- backwards and forward snowballing

## 2. Related Work

- the search strategy is key to ensuring a good starting point
- *often it is difficult to formulate good search strings as often the terminology is not standardized*
- *the end result could also be a lot of irrelevant papers, and filtering out from this is error prone*
- two important conclusions
  1. the database search can become the only step in the search strategy
  2. there is the possibility to miss important literature
- snowballing is the best way to find resource published in obscure journals according to (Greenhalgh and Peacock, 2005)

## 3. Snowballing procedure

- basic steps of planning a literature study are still relevant (kitchenham 2007)

### 3.1 Start Set

- there are no definitive rules on how to obtain the initial start set of sources
- difficulty of terminology (Jalali, S. and Wohlin, C. 2012) 

### 3.2 Iterations

- before starting the first iteration of snowballing, it is important to be sure about the inclusion of selected sources in the start set

#### 3.2.1 Backward snowballing

- Go through the reference list of all the included papers
- don't look at the paper directly, but instead look at where the paper is used and referenced in as that gives a better picture of what the paper is 
- only after that look directly at the new paper and make the final decision if it should be included into the review

#### 3.2.2 Forwards snowballing

- using google scholar find where the paper is citated, but not quoted
- otherwise quite the same approach as in backward snowballing

#### 3.2.3 Inclusion and exclusion

- if a paper is included too early, it might be necessary to rollback and remove all the other papers also that was a result of the inclusion of the initial paper
- it is important to do one iteration at a time to get traceability

### 3.3 Authors

- authors should be contacted when there are no new papers in an iteration

### 3.4 Data Extraction

- data extraction can be done at the same time as deciding if the paper is included or not

## 4. Replication

### 4.1 Introduction

### 4.2 Start Set

### 4.3 Iteration 1

### 4.4 Iteration 2

### 4.5 Iteration 3

### 4.6 Efficiency

### 4.7 Authors

### 4.8 Citation Matrix and Timeline

### 4.9 Reflections

### 4.10 Comparison

## 5. Discussion snowballing

## 6. Summary

- the procedure is illustrated and evaluated
- 

## Personal interpretations from the text

- well written and easy to understand
- to what degree will I use the techniques presented in this paper?
  - where is the line of too much?
- snowballing is not possible to google search results
