## Abstract

- DX inspired by the concept of UX, but noting also the special context of software development
- address DX of Vaadin Designer in terms of UX, intrinsic motivation, and flow state
- comparison of the DEXI scale and Mann-Whitney U test
- discussion about the factors that construe DX

## 1 Introduction

- requires skill to create GUIs
- traditionally the developed GUI is only visible after it is runnable
- GUI designer is a piece of software
- UI designer is a person
- GUI designers bridge the gap between design and code implementation
- developers are rarely seen as users of development tools in research
- all that is true to any user according to UX definition, should apply also to developers
- however, the dualistic role of the developer both as user of development tools and designer of new software products makes the developer special
- DEXI scale developer for assessing the particularities of DX
- contributions towards increased understanding of DX

## 2 Background

## 3 Method

## 4 Results

## 5 Discussion

## 6 Limitations and Future Work

## 7 Conclusion

- DEXI scale for assessing DX of development tools
- quantitative and qualitative results on DX
- the participants who reported bad UX, also reported bad flow state experiences and intrinsic motivation
- DX can be improved by fostering the developer's interest and enjoyment, offering rewarding experiences, supporting challenge-skill balance and feeling of competence
- quick feedback is key when creating a desirable product for the developers
- supporting action awareness and providing a sense of control are also key factors of good DX
