### 4.1 Overview of methods used

- semi-structured interviews
- hour long workshop for selected employees to evaluate the improvement ideas
  - the improvement ideas came from the empirical study and existing literature 

### 4.2 Theory and literature review

- scientific literature
- book
- googling
- looking at other similar companies websites 

### 4.3 Empirical research

#### 4.3.1 Semi-structured interviews

- (DiCicco-Bloom and Crabtree, 2006)
- "understanding human behaviour and individual people's perception about how the tools and practice, or culture and structure support the sharing of knowledge between projects inside the organization and what the perceived problems are"

##### 4.3.1.1 Sampling

- Every person in a project has different needs and requirements against knowledge management
- find key informants, some with a lot of experience and some that are in an ongoing project
- 12 interviewees were selected as key informants
- 3 long-term employees
- 11 interviewees from the same tribe (team)

##### 4.3.1.2 Interviewees

- Variety of different kinds of people

##### 4.3.1.3 Interview questions, process, and data

- 2 different set of questions
  - understanding the interviewee's point of view (A)
  - getting to know the background, current state and effect of a tool or practice that helps knowledge sharing in one way or the other (B)
- usage of hints if the interviewee didn't come up with any practices
  - this helped to get the discussion going
- everything said in the interviews were kept confidential, and only the researcher had the access to them
- total amount of 30h of interview recordings

#### 4.3.2 Participant observation

  - second half focused on discussing the improvement ideas
  - finally a light validation exercise
