# Consequences of Unhappiness While Developing Software

https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3105568

## Abstract

- comprehension of consequences of unhappiness among developers is still too shallow
- studying unhappiness could lead to cost-effective ways to enhance the working conditions, job performance, and limiting of psychological disorders
- qualitative data analysis
- questionnaire

## 1. Introduction

- happy-productive worker thesis
- software developer happiness is correlated to performance, productivity, and quality
- maximizing happiness or minimizing unhappiness
- aim to broaden the understanding of the unhappiness of software developers

## 2. Related Work

- happiness is a sequence of experiental episodes
- high activation and low pleasure levels are shown to be predictors of high versioning requirements
- The concept of attractors – affective experiences that earn importance and priority to a developer’s cognitive system – was theorized to have the biggest impact on development performance
- Positive affective states were perceived to be those that enhance development productivity. The negative affect most prevalently perceived was frustration, which was also the one perceived to deteriorate productivity the most.

## 3. Method

- 

## 4. Results

### 4.A Descriptive statistics


### 4.B Internal Consequences - Developer's Own Being

- low cognitive performance
- mental unease or disorder
- low motivation
- work withdrawal
- low productivity

### 4.C External consequences - Process

- delay
- deviate from the process
- broken flow

### 4.D External consequences - Artifact-oriented

- low code quality
- discharging code

## 5. Discussion

### 5.B Recommendation for Practitioners

-  previous research [4] has suggested that intervening on the affect of developers might have relatively low costs and astonishing benefits.

## 6. Conclusion

- the present study enforces the stance that many aspects of software engineering research require approaches from the behavioral and social sciences
