# Performance Alignment Work: How software developers experience the continuous adaption of team performance in Lean and Agile environments

## What is Abstract

- The understanding from this paper can be used to help form an guide for high-performing software teams and also to improve the conditions of software developers
- The theory, Performance Alignment Work, a framework? was created
- Teams are constantly looking at their own performance, and trying to improve based on that
- Trying to improve the performance, there has to be improvement on the soft factors like communication, team spirit, team identity, and values 

## 1. What is Introduction

- performance and the factors affecting it is constantly changing in the highly volatile environment of software engineering
- in the previous paper, the study focused on performance experience in agile context 
- This paper is about further investigating the similarity and difference in performance experience of devs in different companies
- RQ
  - how is team performance experienced
  - relationship between perceived performance
  - difference between different types of companies

## 2. What is Theoretical background

- grouping skilled individuals is not a team

### 2.1 Definition of Performance

### 2.2 Performance influence factors

### 2.3 Team performance models

## 3. What is Research approach

## 4. What is Results

### 4.1 The Meaning of performance

- understanding the individual job roles vs seeing the big picture
- performance is about fulfilling expectations that originates from some concept of end customer

### 4.2 Factors impacting performance

- performance facilitators
- atmosphere enables communication and vice versa
- performance disruptor are distributed work and re-organization
- double-edged factors can be both positive and negative
- testing and tools are heavily related to the processes and to facilitate performance

### 4.3 Adapting performance

- Adapting to changes depends on the viewpoint of the change
  - change can be internal or external
- steering mechanisms in well established organizations and startups are and have to be different

### 4.4 The high-performing software team

- team spirit and pride
- social skills
- intrinsic motivation to perform
- personal development
- team stup
- rewards
- inclusions/exclusion of possible candidates 

### 4.5 Similarities and differences across organisations

#### 4.5.1 Common categories

- ??

#### 4.5.2 Dissimilarities between organisations

- automating testing and tools is possible only for bigger organisations
- 

## 5. What is Discussion and limitations

- 

## 6. What is Conclusions

- Performance should not just be a predefined objectives
- Practitioners experience and reason team performance in a changing environment
- Better understanding of the experience of performance can help in getting the actual performance better
  - i.e. how the team experiences the performance in itself is more important
- Not only managers are involved in defining the meaning of performance
- Performance is a dynamic construct
- Performance is a continuous process of alignment
  - performance improvement should not be done by setting precise measures
- More of a social and not technical view of software development
- Future research 
  1. hypothesis that the experience of software development is about basic social psychology. Interplay between individual and group factors. Impact of different leadership and management styles
  2. how do practitioners alter their behaviour as a result of interpreting the principles of Lean dn Agile software development
  3. Relationships between different stakeholders' evaluations of performance. What aspects of good performance do developers and customer agree or disagree on?

## Personal thoughts about the text

- Very heavy reading
- There is a guide for thematic interviews as an appendix that could be used in this thesis
- What is the difference of this paper to the article "How do Software Developers Experience Team Performance in Lean and Agile Environments?"
- There is a strong sense of exclusion in some of the comments of the interviewees
