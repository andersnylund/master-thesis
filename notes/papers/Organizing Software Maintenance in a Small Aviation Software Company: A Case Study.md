# Organizing Software Maintenance in a Small Aviation Software Company: A Case
Study

https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/39848

## Abstract 

- *"The goal of this study is to identify the key challenges on the maintenance process, implement solutions to tackle them and evaluate their effectiveness afterwards. The data collection methods used in this study are interviews, survey, data exports and workshops."*

## 3 Research methods 

### 3.1 Research approach

#### 3.1.1 Comparison of possible approaches 

- **case study** (Yin (2003, p. 13)) (Easterbrook et al., 2008)(Runeson and Höst, 2009)(Runeson et al., 2012).
  - exploratory and confirmatory
  - case study focuses on observing the phenomenon and deriving theories instead of solving the actual problem
  - *A precondition for conducting a case study is to have a clear and concise research question focusing on explaining how and why certain phenomenon occurs or exists. (Easterbrook et al., 2008)*
- **design science** g (Offermann et al., 2009) (Peffers et al., 2007)
  - *can be conducted in a conceptual environment providing scientific knowledge that can then be applied in real-life context*
  - problem identification, solution design, and evaluation
  - suitable approach if a problem has been identified, and when it is assumed that it can be solved with a single artifact
  - not applicable in my thesis as the problem is quite abstract
- **ethnography** (Easterbrook et al., 2008)
  - outside observation
  - additional details with interviews
  - participant observation => might introduce bias
  - challenge is time requirement and threats to validity
  - objective findings not possible in the case of the thesis, as the researcher has been working for the case company for a relatively long time
- **action research** ((Baskerville et al., 2009))(Easterbrook et al., 2008)(Runeson and Höst, 2009)
  - focused on a change process through involvement in it
  - assumes that the need to solve the problem is always justified and self-evident
  - case study does not address solving the problem at all
  - action research same to design science, as they try to solve the problem
  - this study focuses on the real effect on a real problem, instead of creating new general scientific knowledge
  - In this study observation and interviews were used to identify the first data set, that was then complemented with a survey 

### 3.2 Data collection

- focus mainly on qualitative data instead of quantitative
- problem to be solved is abstract
- because there was a need to measure the effectiveness of the implemented solutions, there was a need for a survey 

#### 3.2.1 Interviews (Easterbrook et al., 2008)(Doody and Noonan, 2013)

- understand individuals, their situation, experience, and thoughts
- structure, semi-structured, and unstructured
- the interviews in this study were prepared beforehand and therefore unstructured might not be the right explanation of the technique used
- first interviews
  - identify the used maintenance models and problem in them
  - prioritize company focus points
- some interviews were not audio recorded as notes were enough to memorize the key points 

#### 3.2.2 Maintenance knowledge survey

- surveys are used to gather knowledge about a large population by picking a sample of it
- survey doesn't work when gathering information from the past => only to measure present situation
- survey created with Google Forms
- techniques were used to produce better results 

#### 3.2.3 Workshops (Smeds et al. 2015)(Lyman 1987)

- both interviews and workshops aim to gather thoughts and feelings on a specific subject
- compared to interviews, in workshops the participants are collaboration with each other and the researcher might only need to observe and do the facilitation 
- when performing a change the workshop can be seen as something that has been decided together instead of in a top-down manner
- participants, boundary objects, and external facilitators
- problematic if everyone has contradicting ideas of the topic
- external facilitator will probably not be possible
- individual thinking, pair discussions, and group discussions (think-pair-share)
- individual thinking by writing post-its
- pairing so that each part in a pair does not know each other that well
- after working in pairs the findings are 

#### 3.2.4 Data export from tracking systems

- a ticket and a timetracking system were analyzed to support measurement of the change 

### 3.3 Research phases

- action research has five main phases: diagnosis, action planning, intervention, evaluation, and reflection
- only one iteration of the phases was done

#### 3.3.1 Initial state analysis

- first interview with CTO, COO, and CCO
- based on first interview a survey was generated
- workshop to get the initial state and broader viewpoint of the employers

#### 3.3.2 Proposing solutions 

- the first initial literature guided finding the problem
- after the first workshop and interview, and after defining and prioritized the problems there was a second literature review to find possible solutions from theoretical frameworks
- again, instead of selecting the proposed changes they were done together in a second workshop in February

#### 3.3.3 Implementation

- implementation phase lasted for 7 weeks

#### 3.3.4 Evaluation and reflection

- third workshop after the implementation phase

## 9 Discussion

### 9.1 Research outcomes

#### 9.1.1 The main problems in the initial state

- usage of informal communication channels
- *Lacking the sufficient amount of resources to run proper structured processes easily leads to a situation where tasks are handled on an ad hoc basis by certain key personnel, which leads to further challenges while the company grows*
- 

#### 9.1.2 The most suitable solutions to identified problems

#### 9.1.3 Effectiveness of the selected solutions

### 9.2 Threats to validity

#### 9.2.1 Construct validity

#### 9.2.2 Internal validity

#### 9.2.3 External validity

#### 9.2.4 Reliability

### 9.3 Future research

## Personal interpretations from the text

- This thesis is studied to get a good understanding and view on good practices on how to conduct and perform workshops and interviews to solve a context dependent problem
- It will probably give good directions to my master's thesis
- My thesis will focus on generating new general scientific knowledge and not a specific problem
- Would ethnography combined with interviews be the best approach for this study?
- *prioritize company focus points*
- what was the concrete implementation in this case?
- could this study also include an electronic survey
  - this would yield a much higher answer rate, however it might not be a really good approach as the study subject is quite abstract and undefined, which makes it really difficult to create a survey about
  - surveys are better to validate things whereas interviews are to identify new aspects and viewpoints to a topic 
- one approach could also be to conduct a workshop where all different kinds of people would join and it would be audio recorded
- what is good facilitation in a workshop?
- contact someone who has done workshops before
- company’s high level business strategy
- there is a lot of discussion about the selected processes and the reasoning behind them
