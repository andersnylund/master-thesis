# Mobile Application Development Training in Mobile Software Ecosystems: Investigating the Developer Experience

## Abstract

- Evaluate developers' experience during training
- study on the the difference between process-based and ad hoc approach
- MSECO = Google play store, iOS app store

## 1 Introduction

- MSECO (keystones) wants to attract external developers to create revenue
- Human characteristics, behaviors, and cooperation have great impact on the software product 
- one of the strategies use by keystones is training
- evangelist is a keystone's employee that support external developers
- DX consists of experiences developer may have as part of their involvement in the software development process in an MSECO
- trainings are a continuous strategy that all keystones to establish organization-developer partnerships
- process-based approach to support developer to create/publish application and evangelists to plan and execute trainings in the MSECO context
- analysis done on conversation between developers and evangelists

## 2 Background

### 2.1 Mobile Software Ecosystem (MSECO)

- the ecosystems contain applications, developers, and users that form complex relationships similarly to biological ecosystems
- reason to study ecosystems is to understand the processes that support products that are created and consumed
  - the products themselves feed the ecosystem
- healthy ecosystem
  - the store usually has quality criteria
  - health indicators like number of downloads and average rating
  - relationship between developers, users, evangelists, and mobile applications
- keystone: google
- developer: consulting company
- evangelist: google employee creating tutorials

### 2.2 Developer Experience

- DX is about all experiences that relate to artifacts and activities the developer performs when developing mobile applications
- mobile application developers:
  - individual / organization
  - innovative
  - milked
  - optimizer
  - copycat
  - flexible
  - multi-homing
- processes
  - support
  - development

### 2.3 Support Process

- evangelist is responsible for this
- evangelists offer tools and materials to guide developers

### 2.4 Development process

- aid developers to think, plan, and build mobile apps
- provide information and align app development with keystone's goals
- app developers don't use any formal development processes
- development processes help developers organizing their activities during mobile app development trainings

## 3 Related work

- PAW studies the DX regarding the performance
  - *"However, the authors did not analyze performance expected from profiles, contributions, and alignment with the keystone's goals"*
- the study wants to know the individual differences in DX in MSECO trainings
- MSECO trainings enable developers to interpret their performance based on the alignment with the MSECO goals
- th assumption is that improving the DX has positive impact on software development and engagement

## 4 Study planning and design

- the study was done with the Windows Phone MSECO
- 2 evangelists that had the same personality type
- one of evangelists was also a researcher
- MSECO have often partnerships with universities so they both benefit from it
- all students had previous experience with Android MSECO
- the groups did not differ much from each other

## 5 Study execution

- after the training session, the developer starting developing their applications and the support started lasting for 2 weeks
- preconceived DX categories of Fagerholm was used

## 6 Results' analysis

- Evangelist with processes (group 1) was interacting more 
  - **isn't it better that the developers are the ones talking in the chat?**
- In group 2 the evangelist was more setting goals than helping?
- Group 1 was talking about the development infrastructure
- Group 2 was talking more about what they should be building
- evangelist 2 was more concerned about reaching the goal of mobile applications published
- evangelist 1 had already during the training got the developers starting, and therefore focused more on supporting the developers with their infrastructure
- identified steps for keystone's governing developers using DX e.g. from the point of view of the keystone (google, apple)
  1. create guidelines on how to identify developers
  2. understand each developer profile and their types of contribution to the ecosystem 
     - some developers support with technical material, some create and lead communities (e.g. android meetups)
  3. promote production of each contribution. Track these contributions
  4. create a plan for each source of DX (Fagerholm's 3), and how it is governed
-  

## 7 Threats to validity

## 8 Conclusion and future work

- the processes helped in understanding DX during the training sessions
- the process approach was measured against ad hoc approach
- results can be used to mitigate risks in trainings
- analysis of DX sources is of interest to keystones
- *"there is a need to study the human and social factors that can influence process adoption and the the product quality"*
- *"if we improve DX, we can have more developers engaged in contributing to the ecosystem platform"*

## Personal thoughts about the text

- Not good English and quite difficult to read and understand what is the message of the paper
